# Welcome to the Meat Grinder

*Ahhhhh... Fresh Meat!*


## About this Document

This document is the beginning of my attempt to write a full HAMMERCRAWL! game system from the ground up. This is very much a work in progress.


### Future Plans

The intended result will hopefully be a recognizable game with inspirations from *Dark Dungeons*, *The Nightmares Underneath*, and *Dungeon Crawl Classics*.


### Acknowledgements

HAMMERCRAWL! in this "complete game" format would not exist without the amazing creativity contained in the followed pre-existing games:

* [Dark Dungeons](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177410/Dark-Dungeons) by Blacky the Blackball
* [Dungeon Crawl Classics](http://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/) by Goodman Games
* [The Nightmares Underneath](https://redboxvancouver.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/the-nightmares-underneath-rpg/) by Red Box Vancouver

Seriously, you should probably just go play those instead, they're much better games with much better production values.


### Cost, License, and Contributions

HAMMERCRAWL! is now and always will be a free game. Very few (if any) of these concepts are original to me, and asking for money for the project would just be wrong.

Contributions to testing and development are always welcome.


# About HAMMERCRAWL!

HAMMERCRAWL! is a fantasy dungeon-crawling role-playing game entirely derived from a half-dozen other similar games which were themselves built up from house rules for the older variants of "That One Game" (henceforth just referred to as The OG) that everyone knows. HAMMERCRAWL! doesn't try to do anything new or revolutionary, instead focusing on establishing a familiar-feeling baseline for 100% procedurally-generated tournament-style role-playing. It sands down a lot of the rough points, standardizes a number of odd inconsistencies, and sacrifices more than one established sacred idol of The OG in order to make the game a bit more approachable by noobs and randos that may plop down to play at a public tourney.

This text won't try to introduce you to the hobby or explain the ideas of role-playing to a novice reader of the genre. If this is your first introduction to a game text, good god, Lemon, I hope you enjoy reading but a lot of the text may be confusing. Good luck, and god speed.


## Materials of Play

A game of HAMMERCRAWL! requires the following materials of play.

### The Basics

* The game rules
* Multiple sets of gaming dice, including: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and at least one d30. You may also find the other "funky" dice to be helpful on some random tables (d5, d14, d24, etc).
* Various writing utensils
* The spells and monsters from at least one other "classic" game (I tend to use *Dark Dungeons*, but YMMV).


### The Randomizers

This method focuses entirely on spontaneous, random play, and as such you're going to need a buttload of Random Generator tools. A good number of these are linked in [the base Readme file](./README.md) as well as at the end of this document in Appendix R.


### The Divining Dice

The Hammersmith will need a special set of "Divining Dice" for assistance with generating threats, challenges, and other dungeon content on the fly. As of January 2019, the HAMMERCRAWL! process has been revised to make use of the custom color-coded dice from the **Genesys** role-playing game, published by Fantasy Flight Games. The dice are available anywhere that game is sold, including online retailers and your FLGS. We recommend getting two complete sets, as that should likely be more than enough for a complete dungeon.

If you go not have the physical dice, there are a number of apps that can be used instead:

* [Heroku Web App](https://rpg-dice-roller.herokuapp.com/genesys)
* [Official Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fantasyflightgames.GenesysDice&hl=en_US)
* [Official iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genesys-dice/id1297007531?mt=8)

The legacy version of this system used the dice from the now out-of-print 3rd Edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. The previous incarnation of the rules for using those dice are now found in Appendix W of the Smith's Guide.

Details on the individual dice and their usage in HAMMERCRAWL! are located in the Smith's Guide.


### Additional Things

You may find the following useful as well:

* Monster Books from other old school games
* Treasure Books from other old school games
* [The Gamemaster's Apprentice series of card decks](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/213131/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Fantasy-Deck)
* [Monster Mod Cards](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/175652/Monster-Mod-Cards)
* [Dungeonmorph Dice and Cards](http://dungeonmorphs.com/)


## The Basics of Play

HAMMERCRAWL! is an old-school dungeon crawl based game. One of you will take on the role of the Hammersmith (aka Dungeon Master, Game Master, Judge, or whatever you like), and guide the proceedings. The rest of you will take on the roles of Players, and in turn guide Adventurers through a deathtrap meat-grinder of a dungeon that the Hammersmith describes for you.

**Player Roles and Expectations:**

* Role-play the character you have created (or drawn).
* Create Story by describing your Adventurer's actions, motivations, successes, and failures.
* Go into the Dungeons described by the Hammersmith
* Lead your Adventurer forth to Get Rich or Die Trying

**Hammersmith Roles and Expectations:**

* Arrange and master tools for spontaneous creation of play.
* Improvise description of the world around the Adventurers, and the actions it takes against and in response to them.
* Create Story by describing the dungeon environments that the Adventurers explore, and the perils and treasures that they encounter within.
* Enhance the world with Non-Player Characters and other interesting denizens.

Both the Hammersmith and the Players will work together to feed a group of Adventurers to a dungeon, and see who survives. Inside the dungeon, the heroes will encounter wicked monsters, insidious traps, maddening mazes, and hopefully gobs of amazing treasures. Those that fight bravely and/or wisely may just have what it takes to make it out of the dungeon, return to town, and level up to greater tiers of personal power and glory.


## The Tenets of HAMMERCRAWL!

**Tenet the First: Embrace Death** - You will die, frequently, and in hilarious ways. It's expected. Embrace it. There's no need to learn to "play better" and no need to "git gud" in this game. It's *meant* to be a brutally hilarious meat grinder. Enjoy the process of character divining, and even more so the churn of characters that replace your first ones, all of which will inevitably die memorably in the darkest of dungeons. And when they die, draw tombstones on the back of their sheets and give them amazing epitaphs, too!

**Tenet the Second: Don't Take it Seriously** - Have fun, and don't get too attached to your characters. Develop awesome stories and personalities for them, but do it all for a laugh. Develop their wants and dreams and then relish when those hopes are destroyed forever by the spiked maul of a demonic bugbear. Ham it up as much as you can, and generally have a good time with it all.

**Tenet the Third: Fail Forward** - One core focus of almost every die roll in the system is that failure isn't always final. In HAMMERCRAWL! you are encouraged to embrace "failed" rolls and push them even harder into success, via the principle of "Failing Forward." This is explained in detail immediately below, but the real short version is that a "failed" roll doesn't always mean a failed action, and instead can often mean that you succeed with consequences which make things worse than you had any good reason to expect. And by "worse" we mean "more fun!"


### On Success, Failure, and Failing Forward

In most single-die pass-fail RPGs spawned from the OG, when you roll a check (usually a d20 roll such as an attack, a save, or a skill attempt) and your total modified result doesn't equal or exceed the "target" or "difficulty" number, you fail at your check. This usually concludes the transaction, move along, next.

In HAMMERCRAWL! we do things differently, embracing the spirit of "failing forward" on every such check. Should you roll a check in this game and score a "failure" result, you always have the option to choose to Fail Forward by declaring that you actually succeeded, but with unintended consequences.

Narratively and mechanically, this means that you succeeded at accomplishing the core focus of your check: you won the footrace, you stabbed the goblin, you saved against the medusa's gaze, etc. However, in choosing to turn the failure into a success, you have consented to Pay the Price.

"The Price" is whatever the Hammersmith deems an appropriate and/or interesting (and usually bad) consequence of your action. 'Smiths are advised to base the severity of the consequences on the difference in die roll needed to pass the check, but in truth they can do whatever they please as long as the story is made more awesome as a result. And the best part is that you (the player) must decide to use the Fail Forward option *before* the consequences are decided upon.

Following the examples above, here are some suggested consequences:

"You won the foortace..."

* "...but victory was given to the Prince anyway, because the game was rigged."
* "...but pushed yourself so hard that you threw up on the King during the award ceremony."

"You stabbed the goblin..."

* "...but they pulled out a grenade as a dying action, taking both of you in the blast."
* "...but he was just a distraction so the bugbear could get a good shot, take 1d8 damage."

"You saved against the medusa's gaze..."

* "...because your brother stood between you at the last second. He's now the statue that you were supposed to be, I hope you appreciate his sacrifice."
* "...because you accidentally panic-cast that Darkness spell upon yourself. You and everyone around you are fighting blind in the magical darkness, but hey, at least none of you can see the medusa now, right?"

As evidenced, sometimes the cost is worse than the success, but that's the price. Be sure to make it fit the moment, and make it awesome.


## Established Systemic Conventions

If you're familiar with The OG and its many derivatives, the following should probably make sense to you. HAMMERCRAWL! is built with the following system assumptions:

* **Roll High:** The system is tooled around all D20 rolls being targeted high. 20 is good, 1 is bad.
* **Stat Rolls:** Class is determined first, then 3D6 stats in order, with highest two determined by the class.
* **Race as Class:** Races are implemented as entirely separate character classes.
* **Skills:** In addition to expectations based on class abilities and career backgrounds, every character gets 4 random skills they are somehow good at as well.
* **Feats:** There are no "Feats" in this game, at least as codified by other derivatives of The OG.
* **No Natural Darkvision:** No characters begin the game with natural low-light or darkvision. The management of light sources is a crucial part of play for every character in the party.
* **Armor Class:** Base 10, Ascending.
* **Time Tracking:** The "Beat" is the equivalent of the "Turn" in older editions (i.e. 10 minutes of in-game time). "Turn" is instead applied to Combat only. A Combat round is 10 seconds of time, thus there are 6 Rounds in a Minute. However, any single combat encounter *always* advances game time by one full Beat.
* **Combat Initiative:** Side-based, then determined by Leaders.
* **Damage:** Weapon damage is based on the Hit Die of the character using the weapon.
* **Experience Levels:** 15 levels for all characters. To attain the next Experience Level, you need that level x10 in Experience Points (XP), and every time you gain a level your XP reserve resets to zero.
* **Experience Points (XP):** XP is gained from exploring new locations and defeating the challenges within.
* **Advantages and Disadvantages:** They're in here, and they're incremental.
* **Consolidated Spellcasting:** Clerics and Magic-Users have much closer-aligned rules for spellcasting and memorization. This is to assist new/random drop-in players in having fun with playing these two classes, which have historically presented challenges for noobs.






# CHAPTER: Creating Your Character

You will need the following for this process:

* A printed character sheet or other such notepad
* A writing utensil
* A full set of gaming dice


#### Sidebar: The Online Generation Method

I strongly recommend using [my companion random character generator program](https://github.com/nonplayer/OldSchoolCharGen) for this process. It allows entire stacks of characters to be generated with a few keystrokes. Hammersmiths can thus create a single pile of replacement characters for instant access and insertion into an ongoing dungeon, saving time in longer play sessions with high death tolls.


## Step 1: Roll Your Class

First and foremost, you must randomly determine your new character's Class. Roll 3d6, and then consult the following table:

| Roll  | Class             |
|-------|-------------------|
| 3-4   | Elf Exemplar      |
| 5-7   | Dwarf Defender    |
| 8-13  | Human*            |
| 14-16 | Halfling Burglar  |
| 17-18 | Half-ogre Berserker |

\*If human, roll 1d4 to determine your actual class:

1. Cleric
2. Fighter
3. Magic-User
4. Thief

**Note:** These tables are for a primarily humanocentric fantasy setting, such as that established in The OG. Adjust these as needed for your campaign setting.


## Step 2: Record your Class Data

Each class has its own special rules and abilities. Take note of yours using the references below.


### Dwarf Defender (Warrior)

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 25
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Luck, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Area = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour except longbows.
* **Bonus Languages:** Dwarf

**Born in Armor:** Dwarves in Medium or heavier armour do not suffer AC penalties from low DEX mods. Heavy armour never reduces their movement speed.

**Born of Earth and Stone:** Dwarves are never lost when underground with solid earth or stone beneath their feet. They know the local grades and depth, and can feel air flow naturally. They have a 50% chance of detecting hidden stonework just by passing, and automatically find it if they spend a Beat searching.

**Dwarf Battlemaster:** Dwarves have a bonus melee-only attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, a Dwarf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Dwarven Resilience:** Dwarves have advantage on all of their Good saves.

**Shield Brothers:** Dwarves can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice. Additionally, dwarves do not lose the AC bonus of their shield when using the bash.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1      | 0    | 1     | 0    | 1    | 0    | 0     |
| 2     | 2      | 0    | 2     | 0    | 2    | 1    | 1     |
| 3     | 3      | 1    | 3     | 1    | 3    | 1    | 1     |
| 4     | 4      | 1    | 4     | 1    | 4    | 2    | 2     |
| 5     | 5      | 1    | 5     | 1    | 5    | 2    | 2     |
| 6     | 6      | 2    | 6     | 2    | 6    | 3    | 3     |
| 7     | 7      | 2    | 7     | 2    | 7    | 3    | 3     |
| 8     | 8      | 2    | 8     | 2    | 8    | 4    | 4     |
| 9     | 9      | 3    | 9     | 3    | 9    | 4    | 4     |
| 10    | 10     | 3    | 10    | 3    | 10   | 5    | 5     |
| 11    | 11     | 3    | 11    | 3    | 11   | 5    | 5     |
| 12    | 12     | 4    | 12    | 4    | 12   | 6    | 6     |
| 13    | 13     | 4    | 13    | 4    | 13   | 6    | 6     |
| 14    | 14     | 4    | 14    | 4    | 14   | 7    | 7     |
| 15    | 15     | 5    | 15    | 5    | 15   | 7    | 7     |


### Elf Exemplar (Hybrid)

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Mind, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Body, Area, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour. Armour may limit spellcasting.
* **Bonus Languages:** Elf

**Ageless Perfection:** Elves are immune to sleep, charm, slow, haste, aging, and energy drain effects, *unless* those effects are results of the magic of an Elf (self or other, alive or undead).

**Ancient Arcanists (Spellcaster):** Elves can cast spells from the magic-user list. Elves begin the game with a spellbook containing *Read Magic*. Additionally the book contains a base of one (1) randomly-determined bonus spell. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Elf's INT mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Elf adds one (1) new spell to their book from their own ongoing experimentation, and they can add more by transcribing scrolls and magical texts found in dungeons. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Elf can only cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience.

**Armoured Spellcaster:** Elves are better at casting in armour than humans. Elves suffer no chance of spell failure in Light armour, and a 25%/50%/75% chance when wearing medium/heavy/plate armours, respectively. Failed spells are forgotten per normal rules.

**Blade Dancer:** Elves are skilled at fighting with two weapons at once. When wielding two one-handed weapons, Elves roll one extra attack die, but lower their damage die by one step (to a d6) for the entire assault. At level 9, this increases to two extra attack dice.

**Keen Awareness:** Elves are spatially aware of their surroundings at all time. They have a 50% chance of noticing concealed *non-stonework* doors and panels simply by passing near them, and automatically find them if they spend a Beat searching.

**War Adept:** Elves have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, an Elf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 0    | 1     | 1    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| 2     | 1      | 1    | 2     | 2    | 1    | 0    | 1     |
| 3     | 1      | 1    | 3     | 3    | 1    | 1    | 1     |
| 4     | 2      | 2    | 4     | 4    | 2    | 1    | 2     |
| 5     | 2      | 2    | 5     | 5    | 2    | 1    | 2     |
| 6     | 3      | 3    | 6     | 6    | 3    | 2    | 3     |
| 7     | 3      | 3    | 7     | 7    | 3    | 2    | 3     |
| 8     | 4      | 4    | 8     | 8    | 4    | 2    | 4     |
| 9     | 4      | 4    | 9     | 9    | 4    | 3    | 4     |
| 10    | 5      | 5    | 10    | 10   | 5    | 3    | 5     |
| 11    | 5      | 5    | 11    | 11   | 5    | 3    | 5     |
| 12    | 6      | 6    | 12    | 12   | 6    | 4    | 6     |
| 13    | 6      | 6    | 13    | 13   | 6    | 4    | 6     |
| 14    | 7      | 7    | 14    | 14   | 7    | 4    | 7     |
| 15    | 7      | 7    | 15    | 15   | 7    | 5    | 7     |


### Halfling Burglar (Rogue)

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, CHA
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 20
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Area, Body, Death, Luck, Mind, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** None
  - **Bad:** None
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all small weapons one-handed, or medium two-handed. Cannot use two-handed human-sized weapons. Can use shields.
* **Bonus Languages:** Halfling

**Backup Fighter:** Halflings can function as fighters of a sort, when needed. Halflings gain a bonus attack die at levels 4, 8, and 12. When attacking, a Halfling declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Backup Thief:** Halflings can also function as thieves of a sort, in a pinch. They have the following Thief Skills:

* Break & Enter (DEX)
* Climb & Leap (STR, with Disadvantage)
* Find & Seek (WIS)
* Hide & Sneak (DEX, with Advantage)
* Snatch & Grab (DEX)

These are used as per normal Thief Skill rules. Unlike Thieves, Halfling thiefskills do not evolve magically.

**Often Overlooked:** Unless their actions indicate them to be an obvious threat, or their opponents are otherwise specifically predisposed against them, a halfling is always attacked last.

**Sudden Inner Strength:** A Halfling can draw from their inner strength for a sudden display of unexpected fierceness. By spending 1 Hit Point before they roll their attacks, they can increase the damage die size for their attacks this round by one step.

**Tactical Attacker:** Halflings roll with advantage on Tactical Attacks.

**Wee:** Halfling size limits a few of their combat options. They cannot use polearms, long bows, heavy crossbows, or any other weapons that require two hands for humans. Additionally, all item encumbrance sizes are considered one step higher for the Halfling.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 1    | 1     | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1     |
| 2     | 1      | 2    | 2     | 2    | 2    | 2    | 2     |

| 15    | 7      | 15   | 15    | 15   | 15   | 15   | 15    |


### Half-ogre Berserker (Warrior)

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Area, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons and shields. Armour must be custom made.
* **Bonus Languages:** Ogre

**Chaotic Nature:** Berserkers cannot be aligned to Law.

**Large and in the Way:** Half-ogres stand around 7 feet tall or more, and are built like icehouses. All armour must be custom made for them at increased costs and time, and only Halfling-sized creatures or smaller can move through their occupied space if minis and a battlemat are in use. Additionally, they can stow Huge items in gear for 3 encumbrance slots each.

**Murderous Rage:** Berserker blood is instilled with traces of the same dark rage that drives their ogrish ancestors to war against the kingdoms of humans. When a Berserker takes damage, they must make a Mind save (target: 12) or go into an uncontrollable violent fury. During this rage, they have advantage on melee and thrown damage dice rolls, immunity to critical fumbles, and disadvantage on all saves except Body and Death. On their turn, they must take action according to the following priority chain - higher-listed actions are mandatory if possible:

* Melee Attack the strongest-looking enemy within immediate striking range.
* Move to the strongest-looking enemy within charging range and Melee Attack them.
* Thrown (Missile) attach the strongest-looking enemy within Thrown Range.
* Melee Attack the strongest-looking *standing* living creature (friend or foe) within immediate striking range (Mind Save DC 12 each time to avoid attacking an ally).
* Mind Save (target: 15) to break out of rage: if successful you mind clears and you spend the round panting, if failed you Collapse to the ground unconscious (remain unconscious for 3d6 minutes)

A Berserker can choose to voluntarily fail either save and willingly let the rage overtake them and/or knock them unconscious afterward. They can also trigger it on their own by causing themselves 1 point of damage with a weapon.

**Savage Warrior:** Berserkers have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, a Berserker declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Two-Hander:** When using a two-handed melee weapon, Berserkers roll d12 damage dice with their attacks (instead of d10), applying the result to all attacks that hit.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1      | 0    | 1     | 0    | 1    | 0    | 0     |

### Human Cleric (Caster)

* **Prime Stats:** WIS, CHA
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Luck, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Mind, Body, Death = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Area = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour that are not otherwise prohibited by their deity.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Aligned to the Gods:** Clerics must believe in a great deific cause, and as such cannot be of Neutral alignment.

**Heavenly Power (Spellcaster):** Clerics channel the divine will of their deities to cast spells from the Cleric spell list. Clerics begin the game with a holy prayerbook which contains a base of two (2) randomly-determined clerical prayers. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Cleric's WIS mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Cleric is divinely inspired to add two (2) new prayers to their book, and they can add more by sanctifying, converting, and transcribing prayers to other gods found on scrolls and books in dungeons. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Cleric can only cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience.

**Turn Away the Unholy** Once per Day per Level of Experience, a Cleric can hold aloft the symbol of their righteous faith and turn back undead, devils, demons, and any others that the Hammersmith deems to be enemies of their faith. All such opponents must make Mind saves based on the difference in Level/HD Tiers. Targets who fail this save must cower, flee, or possibly even take damage or be destroyed.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 0    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 1    | 1     |
| 2     | 1      | 0    | 1     | 1    | 1    | 2    | 2     |

| 15    | 7      | 5    | 7     | 7    | 7    | 15   | 15    |


### Human Fighter (Warrior)

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Area = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Fighters can use all weapons, shields, and armour.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Combat Superiority:** Fighters have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. When attacking, a Fighter declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Not Today!:** At first level and each level after, the Fighter gains a single use of "Not Today!" When a Fighter would take damage (from any source) that would reduce their Hit Points from positive to Zero or below, they can spend a use and instead remain at 1 HP and negate the rest of the damage from that attack. These uses accumulate with each level, but each use is permanently lost upon spending.

**Primary Tank:** Fighters have advantage on all Hit Dice rolls, *and* reroll all 1s on Hit Dice.

**Shield-Trained:** Fighters can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice. After a bash, the Fighter loses the shield's AC bonus until the start of their next turn in combat.

**Two-Hander:** When using a two-handed weapon, Fighters roll an *extra* damage die with their attacks, applying the result to all attacks that hit.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1      | 0    | 1     | 0    | 1    | 0    | 1     |

### Human Magic-User (Caster)

* **Prime Stats:** INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d4 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** D: You have no level-based combat bonus to attacks.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Mind = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Luck = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Body, Area, Death, Rally = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can not use two-handed weapons except staves. Can not wear heavy armour or use shields. Other armour can cause spell failure.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Armour-Inept:** Magic-users cannot wear Heavy armour, and suffer a chance of spell failure while wearing other armour. In Light armour, the chance is 50%, and in Medium armour the chance is 75%. Failed spells are forgotten per normal rules.

**Bloodcaster:** Magic-users can choose to take damage instead of forgetting spells. The amount of HP damage taken is equal to the level of spell just cast. If below Zero HP, this burns CON instead.

**Highcaster:** Magic-users (only) can prepare and even attempt to cast spells of higher level than they normally would be able to, provided they have a copy of the spell in their book. Casting the spell requires permanent loss of INT score equal to the difference in allowed spell levels. Such INT loss can only be regained through the use of the Cleric's *Restoration* spell. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

**Magical Mind:** Magic-users can cast the spell *Read Magic* freely and at will, without need to prepare, memorize, or roll.

**Wizardly Ways (Spellcaster):** Magic-users are best known for their ability to cast spells from the Magic-User spell list. Magic-Users begin the game with a spellbook containing *Read Magic*. Additionally the book contains a base of two (2) randomly-determined bonus spells. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Magic-User's INT mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Magic-user adds two (2) new spells to their book from their own ongoing experimentation, and they can add more by transcribing scrolls and magical texts found in dungeons. Spells are cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Magic-User can safely cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience. Take note of their Highcast ability, above.

**Wizardly Weaponry:** Magic-users can make use of new special mage-only weapons: The Wand and The Staff. Be warned that actively using these tools will mark you as a magician, and likely increase your chances of becoming a target priority by smart enemies...

### Human Thief (Rogue)

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** C: You add 1/3 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Area, Luck = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Death, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Body = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Thieves can use any weapons and armour that the Hammersmith deems to be suitably sneaky.
* **Bonus Languages:** Thieves' Cant

**Stabbity!:** When a Thief is using a melee weapon to attack a foe against which the Thief either has attack advantage or is hidden from perception, the thief doubles their damage against that foe on a successful hit. This multiple increases by +1 at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.

**Thief Skills:** Thieves have access to a special array of professional skills which can allow them special unique methods to assess and even bypass dangers. These skills (and their base modifying stats) are:

* Appraise & Identify (INT)
* Break & Enter (DEX)
* Climb & Leap (STR)
* Find & Seek (WIS)
* Forge & Decipher (INT)
* Hide & Sneak (DEX)
* Lie & Cheat (CHA)
* Snatch & Grab (DEX)

At first level the Thief must randomly determine one Thief Skill to be their **Bailiwick**, and one to be their **Failing**. The thief gets advantage on checks related to their Bailiwick, and disadvantage on checks related to their Failing.

At first level, the Thief's skills only work on a "mundane" level. At ninth level, the thief's skills evolve to function on a magical level as well, albeit with Disadvantage in such circumstances. Thief skills and their uses are explained in greater detail in the "Playing Your Character" chapter of this document.

**Thiefy Expertise:** Once per adventure per experience level, the Thief can attempt to reroll a failed Thief Skill check. This count resets upon Returning to Town.

**Tactical Attacker:** Thieves roll with advantage on Tactical Attacks.

**Trapwise:** Thieves have advantage on all Saves against the effects of Traps.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 1    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 1    | 0     |

## Step 3: Roll Your Alignment

HAMMERCRAWL! uses the following five alignments: Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, and Neutral. Roll a d5 to determine yours.


## Step 4: Roll Your Stats

Now roll 3d6 six times, and write them down in order.

*Example: Darla rolls 3d6 six times and writes them down in the order she rolled them: 9, 14, 11, 10, 5, and 17.*

**First** assign your highest rolls *in order of their rolling* to the Prime Stats of your character class. Most classes should have two Prime Stats, some only one, and maybe others three. However many, take the highest rolls from your set in the order they were rolled, and assign them to the Prime Stats in the order they appear on the character sheet.

*Example: Since Darla rolled a Fighter in the first step, she notes that her class's Prime Stats are STR and CON. Darla's highest-rolled stats are 14 and 17. Assigning them in the order rolled, she notes that her new Fighter now has a STR of 14 and a CON of 17.*

**Next** assign the remaining rolls *in order of their rolling* to the remaining empty stats on your character sheet.

*Example: Darla's remaining rolls are 9, 11, 10, and 5. She assigns them in order to her Fighter's remaining stats, which results in a final spread of: STR 14, DEX 9, CON 17, INT 11, WIS 10, CHA 5.*

**Finally** record the stat mods next to each one, using the following table:

| Stat  | Mod |
|-------|-----|
| 3     | -3  |
| 4-5   | -2  |
| 6-8   | -1  |
| 9-12  | 0   |
| 13-15 | +1  |
| 16-17 | +2  |
| 18    | +3  |

Stats are explained in further detail immediately below.


### Basics of Stats

There are six core stats: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). Each stat has a Base Score and a Derived Modifier. The **Base Score** is determined by the initial 3D6 roll. These initial scores are not used much outside of their initial purpose of determining the Stats' derived modifiers. The **Modifier** is a number from -3 to +3, determined by the table above. This number is most commonly used to modify a character's relevant active dice rolls when attempting actions during play.

Each of the six core stats affects certain mechanics, as detailed below:


#### Strength (STR)


**Modifies:**

* Melee Attack Rolls
* Melee Damage Rolls
* Thrown Damage Rolls


#### Dexterity (DEX)

**Modifies:**

* Area Save Rolls
* Armour Class
* Initiative Rolls
* Missile Attack Rolls


#### Constitution (CON)

**Modifies:**

* Body Saves
* Hit Die Rolls


#### Intelligence (INT)

**Modifies:**

* Elf and Magic-User Starting Spells
* Starting Languages
* Starting Skills


#### Wisdom (WIS)

**Modifies:**

* Cleric Starting Spells
* Initiative
* Mind Saves


#### Charisma (CHA)

**Modifies:**

* Rally Saves
* Reaction Rolls


## Step 5: Roll Your Social Status (SOC)

Your character's social status is inherited at birth. Some embrace it, some reject it - it's up to you. This is essentially a seventh Stat (SOC), but rolled separately from the core six, and recorded with its own modifier. This modifier may apply from time to time in dealings within your game world's societies.

The "Coins" column determines your starting cash multiplier for buying initial equipment, explained further below.

| SOC (3d6) | Mod | Coins | Status           |
|-----------|-----|-------|------------------|
| 3         | -3  | x0*   | Scum             |

## Step 6: Roll Your Background

Think of your background profession like a special free skill, and then some. Your character is assumed to know how to do all manner of things reasonably contained within the narrative scope of their background. If there is a question related to that scope, consult your Hammersmith.

To determine your character's background, roll 1d200 (figure it out) and consult the table below:

| #  | Background     | #   | Background      |  | #   | Background     | #   | Background    |

## Step 7: Roll Your Skills

While your character is assumed to have many unwritten skills simply through their class and background (see above), you also begin the game with a few randomly determined skills that you somehow picked up during your pre-game life. Explanations for how you learned these skills are up to you.

At creation, you begin with a base of 4 skills, modified by your INT mod. Thus if you have a -2 INT mod, then you only start with two skills. These are all you get. You will not automatically acquire more skills unless the Hammersmith and/or the whims of the game otherwise gift them to you.

If you're using the character generator python tool, this is already handled for you!

If not, roll 1d20 + 1d100 for each skill, and consult the table below:

| Roll | Skill (Stat)                         |

## Step 8: Roll Your Languages

In addition to whatever bonus languages you have from your Class, there's a chance you might have even more. If you have an INT bonus of +1 or higher, you begin the game knowing that many additional bonus languages. Roll 1d30 for each, and consult the following table. If you roll a language twice, you speak that language as if you were born to it. If you roll it thrice, reroll.

| Roll | Language         | Roll | Language         |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
| 1    | Celestial (Law)  | 16   | Goblin           |
| 2    | Dragon           | 17   | Grimlock         |
| 3    | Drow             | 18   | Halfling         |
| 4    | Druidic          | 19   | Infernal (Chaos) |
| 5    | Dwarf            | 20   | Kobold           |
| 6    | Elemental, Air   | 21   | Manticore        |
| 7    | Elemental, Earth | 22   | Medusa           |
| 8    | Elemental, Fire  | 23   | Naga             |
| 9    | Elemental, Water | 24   | Ogre             |
| 10   | Elf              | 25   | Ophidian         |
| 11   | Esperanto        | 26   | Orc              |
| 12   | Giant            | 27   | Pidgin (special) |
| 13   | Gibberish        | 28   | Pigeon           |
| 14   | Gnoll            | 29   | Sylvan           |

**Pidgin:** If you roll Pidgin, randomly roll two more languages (reroll if you get Pidgin or a language you already know). You now speak both of them very badly.


## Step 9: Randomize Your Miscellaneous Traits

You now get to randomly roll various minor traits and aspects of your character.

### Random Character Tags

Roll 1d400 (figure it out) once and consult the table below. If you're feeling adventurous, roll twice and keep both.

## Step 10: Determine Your Starting Funds, Equipment, and Spells


### Free Starting Gear

All characters begin with the following for free:

* a Satchel (S; Qualities: Bag [5], Fragile, Wearable), containing:
* 1d4 fresh rations (S)
* 1 Torch (S)
* 1 set of clothes to match your rolled attire (M, Wearable)

Additionally, some classes begin with additional starting equipment:

* **Dwarves**: 1 weapon of choice, and 1 small shield
* **Elves**: 1 weapon of choice, and a Spellbook
* **Halflings**: 1 weapon of choice, and a set of Thieves' Tools
* **Half-Ogres**: 1 melee weapon of choice
* **Human Clerics**: a Holy Symbol, and a Prayer Book
* **Human Fighters**: 3 weapons of choice, or 2 weapons and 1 small shield
* **Human Thieves**: a set of Thieves' Tools, and a Dagger
* **Human Wizards**: a Spellbook, and a random wizard weapon (see "Wizard Weapons" in the "Gear" section of this document)

Then determine your gear either through deliberate purchase or through random roll:


### Option A: Purchasing Your Starting Gear

Multiply your SOC score by its associated multiplier, and that's how much money you have to spend. Use the Equipment section of this book to purchase anything you can afford.


#### A Note on Royalty

You read that right, Royalty is rich as fuck and starts with 1000 coins. Enjoy the comforts of a shitload of money, buy all the things you want, and see how long that works out for you down there in that awful, horrible, no-good dungeon...


#### A Note on Scum

If you are lucky enough to roll into Scum as your social status, do not dismay, for you may have just lucked out. Enjoy three completely random rolls on the 'Smith's magic items tables. These are guaranteed to not survive your character's final death, and as such cannot be looted from your body.


### Option B: Randomizing Your Starting Gear

Instead of buying equipment, you can roll it. If you're using the character generator python tool, this is already handled for you!

If not, this section is pending until I get the lists converted from that code...


### Starting Spells

If you're a spellcaster character, part of your "gear" includes a book where you keep those spells or prayers. Now is the time to determine what is in there.

Your class determines how many spells are in your starting spell or prayer book. If your Hammersmith is the generous sort, they may allow you to pick *one* of your spells. All other spells should be randomly rolled on the appropriate Level 1 spell list for your class. See the Magic section at the end of this document for class-based spell lists and descriptions.


## Step 11: Confirm and Note Important Sub-Stats

* **Experience Level** (1) and associated **Character Tier** (1)
* **Hit Die** = Determined by your Class
* **Hit Points (HPs)** = Your Maximum Hit Die, plus your Con Mod, minimum of 1.
* **Armor Class (AC)** = 10 + DEX mod + AC mod from any Armour and Shields
* **Melee Attack Modifier** = STR mod + any class mods
* **Melee Damage Modifier** = STR mod
* **Missile Attack Modifier** = DEX mod + any class mods
* **Movement Speed** = determined by class (human base is 30)
* **Maximum Encumbrance (MaxEnc)** = 1/2 your INT score (rounded down), plus your STR mod.


## Step 12: Name Your Characters

Now it's time to give the character a name. Thing is, *you* don't get to give it that name. Instead, pass your character sheet to the player (*not* the Smith) sitting to your left. *They* get to name your character, and they are encouraged to Go Wild.


## Step 13: Determine Party (Player) Roles

Hopefully the rest of your group has been making your characters alongside one another, and you've now all reached this point together. It's time to determine the party roles, which are mainly for administration and also for the use of the special new Party Actions.

**The Roles to Assign:**

* **Party Leader:** This player is responsible for choosing Initiative orders, and for informing the Hammersmith when the party moves on or takes any of the Party Actions.
* **Mapper:** This player is responsible for translating the Hammersmith's descriptions to a map that the party can use, in whatever artistic fashion the player sees fit.
* **Lootkeeper:** This player keeps a master list of all the loot discovered, so it can be fairly distributed by the party upon returning to town. It might not be wise to assign this role to the Thief...
* **Timekeeper:** The player tracks the passage of game Beats, and keeps track of who is carrying what light sources (and how much time is left on them).


## Now Take It All In

Take a moment to think about the kind of person your character is. Think about their goals, their ambitions, their reasons for doing the things they do. And while you're at it, take a long hard moment to ponder exactly what kind of person they have to be in order to willingly leave everything behind and delve into terrifying and disgusting dungeons.

## Randomized Starting Equipment

TBD


## Extended Equipment Details

The following sub-sections contain collections of extended descriptions of specific items, organized in sections that should be familiar to players of the classic game systems. The alphabetically-sorted contents of each sub-section are by no means exhaustive, instead meant to focus primarily on items which require specific additional description beyond the obvious.


### Equipment Qualities

Be they weapons, armour, or various adventuring tools, all items of gear can be assigned some special qualities. The following list of qualities applies to all the items in this equipment section.

**2H:** This melee weapon must be used with both hands at once. This can trigger certain class-specific combat abilities.

**Bag:** This item adds additional encumbrance slots to the character's inventory.

**Basic:** This is a pretty standard weapon. No special rules, costs 10 coins (usually), and hurts things using your character's Hit Die. The name of the individual weapon is largely just a component to provide narrative color for your character and their combat actions.

**Durable:** This item enjoys an advantage on all its saving throws.

**Fragile:** This item suffers a disadvantage on all its saving throws.

**Reach:** These melee weapons aren't functional within many tight dungeon corridors and spaces, but they provide superior reach in more open combat spaces. When applicable, they give their wielder advantage on melee combat attacks against enemies attacking with non-Reach melee weapons.

**Tactical:** These weapons do not do normal Hit Die based damage. Instead, they can be used as tactical weapons, applying various "status" effects as seen appropriate by the player and the 'Smith. See "Tactical Attacks" in the combat section.

**Thrown:** This melee weapon can be effectively used as a thrown weapon.

**Wearable:** This item can be equipped directly to the character's person, not requiring encumbrance when worn.


### Weapons & Ammunition

**Weapons Table**

* **Name:** The name of the weapon
* **Size:** The encumbrance size when stowed
* **Type:** The type (Melee, Missle, or Special)
* **Cost:** How many coins to purchase the weapon
* **Qualities:** Any special item qualities for the weapon
* **Range:** If Missile or Thrown, shows range in two numbers: Effective/Maximum. See Combat rules for more information.

**NOTE:** For any entry with an asterisk in its data, see the text section below the table for further details.

**Ammunition Table**

**Important Note:** All ammo is purchased in units of 10.

| Ammo           | Size | Cost |
|----------------|------|------|
| Arrows         | S    | 10   |
| Crossbow Bolts | S    | 10   |
| Sling Bullets  | T    | 10   |
| Slingstones*   | T    | Free |

**Blackjack:** Blackjacks can be used as regular melee weapons (doing regular damage), or instead as melee Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Blowgun:** Bolas are missile weapons primarily designed as a mechanism for long-range delivery of poisons. They do no base damage, instead serving as ranged Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Bola:** Bolas are thrown weapons which do no damage, instead serving as ranged Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Net:** Nets are "close-ranged missile" tactical weapons, designed to be held in one hand (or attached at the hip) and thrown with the other, entangling a nearby opponent to either capture them or immobilize them for better attacking. They function as "missile" type weapons, using DEX-modified attacks, but have a melee-only range. Nets do not do damage, instead serving as ranged Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Shield Weapons:** Some shields have special attached weaponry, such as horns, knives, swords, and tusks. In mechanical terms, these are versatile weapons, which can be used either offensively (as their attached weapons) or defensively (giving shield AC bonuses). The player using it must decide each round how they are using it, applying the result until their next subsequent round. See also "Armour & Shields," below.

**Sling and Slingstones:** The base listed stats for the sling assume the user is equipped with actual crafted sling bullets as their choice of ammunition. However, in a pinch a sling user can feasibly put any small hard object into the sling for use as ammunition: coins, marbles, stones off the ground, etc. Any of these items not specifically crafted as sling bullets is considered a "slingstone" for the purpose of mechanics. When using slingstones, reduce damage by -1 (to a minimum of 1) and reduce base range by half (i.e. 40/80).

**Sword, Bastard:** This sword can be used one-handed or two-handed. If used two-handed, it can make use of class-specific 2H bonuses. If used one-handed, it counts as a Basic weapon.

**Whip:** Whips are melee weapons which do no damage, instead serving as melee Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.


### Armour & Shields

**Armour Table**

Descriptors:

* **Name:** The name of the armour
* **Type:** Whether the armour is Light, Heavy, or Plate
* **AC:** The character's AC while wearing the armour
* **Size:** Encumbrance requirement when not worn
* **Cost:** In coins, to have crafted by an armoursmith of suitable skill (With a few exceptions, armour is rarely available for immediate purchase)
* **Qualities:** Any special qualities possessed by the armour

**NOTE:** For any entry with an asterisk in its data, see the text section below the table for further details.

| Name         | Type  | AC | Size | Cost  | Qualities |
|--------------|-------|----|------|-------|-----------|
| Padded       | Light | 11 | M    | 1     | Wearable  |
| Leather      | Light | 12 | M    | 10    | Wearable  |
| Studded      | Light | 13 | M    | 25    | Wearable  |
| Scale        | Heavy | 14 | L    | 50    | Wearable  |
| Chain        | Heavy | 15 | L    | 100   | Wearable  |
| Splint       | Heavy | 16 | L    | 500   | Wearable  |
| Platemail    | Heavy | 17 | H    | 1000  | Wearable  |
| Plate Armour | Plate | 18 | H    | 10000 | Wearable  |

**Shields Table**

| Shield Type    | AC+ | Size | Cost |
|----------------|-----|------|------|
| Shield         | 1   | M    | 10   |
| Shield, Weapon | 1*  | M    | 100  |
| Shield, Tower  | 2   | L    | 100  |

**Shield Weapons:** Shield Weapons can be used as either Shields or hand weapons. If used defensively, they provide standard shield bonuses (+1 to AC). If used offensively, they instead function as their attached weapons.


### Adventuring Gear

In addition to trusty blades and sturdy mail, every adventurer should make sure and kit up with a versatile array of adventuring tools. The vast majority of these have no direct mechanical application, instead existing to serve as situational tools in the story. Sure, you might not need a big iron cooking pot every single moment of the delve, and carrying it everywhere is a gigantic pain in the butt, but you'll regret leaving it behind when the 'Smith decides that one is needed!

In the HAMMERCRAWL! game, adventuring gear is assigned to three different categories based entirely on their costs:

* **Common Gear** is usually easily purchasable at even the smallest of towns, provided a general store is around. This gear always costs a base of a single coin.
* **Rare Gear** is bought at an additional premium, usually due to some mix of being complex in craft, specific in application, and/or made of more expensive materials. This gear always costs a base of 10 coins.
* **Specialty Gear** is anything that is super specialized and/or quite expensive to make. This gear costs a base of 100 coins, and can be quite difficult to acquire in all but the largest cities.

Although the **Bags** have been separated into a fourth sub-section for ease of reference, they are similarly broken into the above three categories based on cost.

The main gear tables below use the following notations:

* **Name:** The name of the item. If there are parenthesis, they contain the base unit and quantity of initial purchase. If no numerical quantity is stated, the quantity is 1.
* **Size:** The Encumbrance size of 1 quantity of the base item (Tiny/Small/Medium/large/Huge). See Encumbrance rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter for more details.

#### Gear Descriptions

Below are extended special details on the specially-noted items from the above lists.

**Acid Flask:** When used as a thrown grenade weapon, deals 1d6 initial acid damage to a single target. The target takes an additional 1d4 acid damage each round for 1d4 additional rounds.

**Alchemist Fire:** When used as a thrown grenade weapon, deals 2d6 initial acid damage to a single target, and 1d6 acid splash damage to all targets within 5 feet of the impact. The initial target takes an additional 1d6 acid damage each round for 1d6 additional rounds.

**Antitoxin:** When consumed, you gain advantage on Body saves vs poison effects for the next hour. If you are already poisoned, consuming antitoxin allows you to immediately attempt a new save.

**Bandoliers:** When worn, these provide three gear slots which can hold nothing larger than Small in size. This effectively allows for up to 30 identical small items, or 300 identical tiny items.

**Bedroll:** Fulfills rest requirements for camping HP recovery actions.

**Candle:** Primarily used as a single-person light source. A lit candle lasts 6 Beats, giving a 5-foot radius of weak light. See the "Light and Darkness" rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter.

**Case, Scroll:** Scroll cases are specialized bag items designed solely for the purpose of safely transporting paper. Each case can safely hold either a single spell scroll, or up to five rolled-up maps or other documents.

**Clothing:** Includes a small variety of items of the listed class of attire. Includes suitable shoes or boots. Usually required for social functions.

**Healing Potion:** Requires a full round to consume, healing 1d6+1 HP.

**Lantern:** Primarily used as a group bright light sources. Making use of a Lantern for this purpose requires the expenditure of one flask worth of lantern oil. A lit lantern lasts 24 Beats (4 hours), giving a 40-foot radius of weak light. See the "Light and Darkness" rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter for further details.

**Lantern Hook:** A special rigged hook that attaches to a backpack and curves over the character's head. Can mount (contain) a single lantern overhead, allowing an active light source without a dedicated hand to hold it. Adds significant height, and counts against the backpacks slots.

**Quiver:** Quivers are specialized bag items designed solely for the purpose of safely transporting ammunition for Bows and Crossbows. Each "slot" in the bag can hold either arrows or bolts.

**Rations, All:** Required for camping and a few other effects. Fresh rations are cheapest, but spoil quickly. Preserved rations are expensive, but resist spoilage in dungeons.

**Sacks, All:** Sacks are handy bag items common to all adventuring lifestyles. Of special note, while empty, folded, and stowed away, sacks count as one size smaller. This is already shown on the bag table.

**Torch:** Primarily used as a small-group limited light source. A lit torch lasts 6 Beats (1 hour), giving a 20-foot radius of weak light. See the "Light and Darkness" rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter.


### Wizard Weapons

Magic-Users (and *only* Magic-Users) have access to a special class of "common" magic items commonly referred to as **Wizard Weapons**. Owing mainly to their renowned squishiness in adventuring parties, wizards across the known world have developed specialist weapons that allow them a chance of contributing more to their adventures than just a handful of spells each day.

There are two specific types of Wizard Weapons in HAMMERCRAWL!: battle wands and battle staves. A **Battle Wand** is a custom-crafted piece of short-range artillery that functions almost identical to a sling in basic combat mechanics. They are Medium one-handed weapons do 1d4 damage at 80/160 range, and use DEX as their attack modifier. They have effectively infinite ammo, but on an attack roll of natural 1 they fizzle out. To recharge a fizzled battle wand, the magic-user must "sacrifice" one of their currently-known spells to empower the wand, forgetting that spell until rememorized.

A **Battle Staff** is meant as more of a defensive item. It functions as a basic Staff for purposes of combat attacks. If a magic-user spends his combat turn taking no action other than gripping the staff with both hands, their AC is raised by +2 until their next action. If hit by a natural 20 attack, the staff is drained of defensive power, and must be recharged using a method identical to that for charging battle wands.

Each battle wand and staff is a unique item, from the base components of its crafting to the energy it exudes. Use the table below to randomly determine the properties of yours.

## Encumbrance

In HAMMERCRAWL!, characters are limited in the amount of items they can carry at any one time. Players manage their gear using an **Encumbrance** mechanic, which consists of a variable number of "gear slots" inspired by certain popular fantasy role-playing and survival-horror video games.

Every character has a "Max Encumbrance" (aka **MaxEnc**) value, which is determined at character creation. The default base value is equal to one-half (1/2) your INT score, rounded up, and modified directly by your STR mod.

You may have been expecting STR to provide the basis, but that is not the case. *What is the reasoning behind this?!* you might ask. HAMMERCRAWL! uses the INT score as the Encumbrance baseline because in our "delve smarter" mentality, carrying more personal gear is mostly of a matter of smart packing and clever weight distribution. A smart character is simply better at carrying and maintaining a well-distributed personal load than a dumb one. But yes, STR *does* still affect things somewhat in the end, thus the additional modifier. If you're both dumb *and* weak, we pray for your (unlikely) safe return.

Characters can increase their Encumbrance slots by purchasing various bags. Each bag item has its own base, which counts against the character's personal encumbrance base. Once added to the inventory, a bag lets the character collect and carry more items, but at the risk of those items being destroyed should something befall the bag.


### Gear Encumbrance

Each piece of gear has a **Size** value which determines how many Encumbrance slots it takes to carry. These sizes are all intentionally gauged against the Human standard of sizes, in accordance with the ancient traditions of dungeon crawling.

* **Tiny:** Requires 1 slot, but identical items can be stacked up to 100 in the same slot. This is Coin and Gem size.
* **Small:** Requires 1 slot, but identical items can be stacked up to 10 in the same slot. This is Coin and Gem size. This is pocket item size.
* **Medium:** Requires 1 slot per item.
* **Large:** Requires 2 slot per item.
* **Huge:** Cannot be stowed; requires active carrying with both hands.

**Wearable items** are special exceptions to Encumbrance. Any gear with the "Wearable" quality does not count against a character's Encumbrance while it is being worn. This includes things like clothing, armour, and backpacks. This exception only applies while worn, however; if such an item is removed and carried, its original Size then counts against the character's encumbrance.

Aside from adding more bags, **characters simply can not exceed their encumbrance limits.** If they try, they will fail: something will fall off, a strap will break, an item will come apart, and so on. It's for reasons like these that many experienced adventurers hire porters to accompany them!

**CLASS NOTE:** Some character classes such as the Halfling and the Half-Ogre have special encumbrance exceptions. See their class details for more information.


### Bags: How to Track Your Gear

Characters' gear lists should be tracked as separate bag-based lists. The first so-called "bag" is all of the character's **Worn and Equipped Items**. This includes anything held directly in their hands (weapons, shields, torches, etc) and anything specifically worn via the "Wearable" quality (armor, clothing, backpacks, etc). These items do not count against Encumbrance. The only limit here is one of narrative sensibility: you can generally only wear one piece or armor, one necklace, one cloak, ten rings, and so on. And most standard characters are assumed to have at most two functioning hands with which to hold things. Different anatomies and states of being will drastically impact this, so in the end it's up to the Player and the 'Smith.

Next, every character has a default **Personal Inventory** with a number of slots equal to the character's Maximum Encumbrance. These are all the items they are stowing on their person, but not necessarily holding or wearing. All equipment on their sheet that is *not* worn on the body must be either carried in their Personal Inventory, or stowed into a carried bag within that Inventory. It is important to note that **items inside bags do not count against the character's base Encumbrance!** Only the bag's own base size counts against the Personal limit. That's why bags are great.

Finally, most characters will wear or carry one or more additional portable bag gear items, such as backpacks, sacks, and chests. These provide additional encumbrance slots beyond the character's base amount. While the bags themselves count their own base Sizes against the character's Personal encumbrance, their individual contents should be listed and collected separately.

**When you acquire new gear** it is up to you to determine where that gear is stowed. Choose wisely.


#### Stacking Bags

Empty bags can be carried inside other bags, provide they fit. However, bags that are actively being used to contain items cannot be contained within larger bags.

The purpose for this rule is to prevent the Nesting Doll effect. Intentionally, a character can only carry as many actively-used bags as their *Personal* encumbrance limit will allow.


#### Bag Destruction

If a bag is destroyed, so too are all of its contents. Determining this is usually handled as part of some saving throw during the game. For most items, the target for that save is 10. Bags have variable saving throw based on their quality, shown in the gear list.


### How much does that body weigh?

This question is inevitably asked in every game, so here's the answer. The encumbrance of a dead, bound, unconscious, or otherwise helpless body is as follows:

* **Halflings:** Large
* **Dwarves, Elves, Humans:** Huge
* **Half-Ogres:** More Huge (as in: not really a thing, good luck with that!)

For other creatures, use the above as relative guidelines.

If those bodies are *significantly* diminished (usually by amputation, etc), count them one category lower. If those bodies are actively resisting, count them as one category higher.


## Experience

Experience is the currency of character advancement in HAMMERCRAWL! As characters go on adventures, defeat threats, and gather wealth, they will accrue experience points (XP) which can be cashed in to increase experience levels.

Experience in HAMMERCRAWL! is earned from the following two activities:

* Killing your Enemies
* Taking their Stuff

Okay, it's a *bit* more complicated than that, but not much. Read on below.


### XP from Challenges

The primary method of XP acquisition is by exploring new locations and dungeon rooms, and then defeating the challenges within those rooms. When a challenge is defeated, each individual surviving member of the party earns an amount of XP based on the following factors:

* Exploring a new Room
* Defeating Challenges
* Dungeon Level Tier Modifiers

In HAMMERCRAWL!, XP is only gained *after* overcoming challenges generated from the Divining Pool. When the party survives a new rolled challenge, use the following process to determine the how *base* XP reward:

1. **Did they explore a new Room?** Each time the party discovers a new "room" or "node" in the dungeon (specifically after using the Explore Action), start the reward with a single XP. This is based on the "node" based method of dungeon exploration; if you're running a room-heavy dungeon, you may need to restrict this to once per "region" of rooms instead.
2. **Did they defeat the challenges?** If there was a challenge in the room, increase the reward by the total number of Xs rolled in that encounter's Divining Pool, plus any additional Suns rolled. Note that Suns *only* add to the XP reward pool if at least one X was also present - rewards without challenge earn no XP!
3. **Are they on a level-appropriate Dungeon Tier?** Multiply the reward based on comparing the party's average level Tier to that of the current dungeon level:


| Dungeon Level Tier is: | Reward Mod:            |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 or more lower        | One-Tenth (round down) |
| 1 lower                | One-Half (round down)  |
| Equal                  | No Mod                 |
| 1 higher               | Multiply x2            |
| 2 or more higher       | Multiply x10           |


**XP Rewards are Individual!** Once calculated, *each* surviving party member receives the same amount of XP. It is not divided among them, instead being given out equally in full. As such there is no inherent XP-driven benefit to sacrificing party members in the hopes of getting more XP.


**Modifying The XP Rewards:** The Hammersmith may choose to raise or lower the rewards after the fact based on group performance or unexpected results. If the party wins against overwhelming odds, for example, the 'Smith may decide to raise the comparative Tier of the enemies to account for an unusual smashing success. Conversely, if the party is just "grinding rats" in the noob zone for an XP mill, the 'Smith may decide to reward them no XP at all for their bad attitudes about the whole thing.


### Ad-Hoc Experience Awards

Hammersmiths may feel like rewarding some players with spontaneous experience boons when those players come up with good ideas or engage in captivating scenes of role-playing. I recommend keeping these to a minimum, and instead making players earn those valuable XPs through the expected core methods, but hey, it's your game, go buck wild. Use the following as a guideline, based on the occurrence that you feel deserves the reward:

* Hah yeah, okay that was pretty cool: 1 XP
* Whoah, that was awesome!: 2 XP
* (table, players, and household all literally explode from the magnitude of sheer bodacious game fire): 3 XP


### Experience and Money

Parties that make it back to town with a *lot* of excess money can choose to convert some of it to XP. In short, for every 1000 coins that they convert to XP (as in: they *can not* spend it on stuff), every surviving member of that dungeon run gains 1 XP.

For more detail, see "Return to Town" in the "Party Meta-Actions" section.


### Leveling Up

In order to attain the next level of ability in your Class, you must accrue an amount of XP equal to the next level times 10. You must then either use the Level Up camp action, or return to Town.

When you attain the next level, the following things happen, in order:

1. Your XP total resets to Zero. Any accrued XP over the amount needed to level up is erased.
2. Your level increases by 1, to a maximum of 15.
3. You gain an additional Hit Die based on your class.
4. Reroll ALL of your Hit Dice, and apply your CON Mod to the total. Your con mod only applies *once*, regardless of how many dice you are rolling. The total becomes your new maximum Hit Points. If the total is less than your previous HP total, your new HP total is instead equal to the previous amount +1.
5. Acquire any new abilities as specific by your Class.
6. Take note of any increases to your Saves.

## Hirelings and Henchmen

(work in progress)

**First off** every Hireling has an associated **Profession.** This states the scope of action they are skilled in.

Example Professions and associated abilities:

* Blah

Additionally, every Hireling has a base Tier, which determines everything else about their usefulness and cost.

**Hireling Tier Table:**

| Hireling Tier | Daily Cost | Expertise | Chance of Finding | Description                       |
|---------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0             | 1 Ration   | 0         | 100 in 100        | Unskilled                         |
| 1             | 1 coin     | 1         | 1 in 10           | Apprentice                        |
| 2             | 20 coins   | 2         | 1 in 20           | Expert                            |
| 3             | 300 coins  | 3         | 1 in 100          | Master                            |
| 4             | 4000 coins | 4         | 1 in 1,000        | Best in Field for the Present Day |
| 5             | 5 XP!      | 5         | 1 in 10,000       | Best in all of History            |

**Tier:** The Tier is used for all associated and relevant mechanics. It determines the base bonus to related abilities, and the number of hit dice the hireling has should they come into question.

**Daily Cost:** Every hireling has a daily cost that must be paid in order to secure their continued service. Tier 0 hirelings merely require food and a place to sleep. At Tiers 1 and higher, their daily cost is equal to their tier matched with a step on the Money Chain (see the table). Yes, those tier 5 hirelings require you to give them XP instead of money!

**Expertise:** Every Hireling gets an Expertise bonus equal to their Tier applied to any checks related to their Professional abilities. Tier 0 hirelings don't get this bonus, but you probably knew that already - you didn't hire them to be good at anything but holding a torch and serving as dungeon "canaries."

**Chance of Finding:** Pretty self-explanatory. If you're looking for one, that's your chance of finding them.

**Description:** A general eyeballing of how that hireling fits into the hierarchy of ability for their chosen profession.


### Finding a Hireling

Go to a place where you might expect a hireling to be found - that means a town or other social center that is most likely *not* in a dungeon. Ask around, chances are you will find someone interesting...


### Putting Up With Your Bullshit (aka Morale)

Hirelings are subject to Morale, but it's handled a bit differently than it is for NPCs not in the PCs' employ. And for Hirelings, the scope covers not just being thrust into dangerous encounters, but also being asked to work beyond the limits of their contracts.

Hirelings prefer to keep their demanded work within the scope of the expertise they were hired for. When you push a hireling to act too often or intensely, or when a Hireling gets into danger far above its preferred safety level, the 'Smith may require you to make a Rally save in order to keep the hireling's current services. This is a check per normal Saves rules, using the difference between your relative Tiers to determine the target (making expensive higher-tier hirelings more difficult to hold onto after pissing them off!).

If you succeed at the save, you keep your hireling for the time being, without changes to your contract. If you fail the save by 5 or less, they may choose to remain, but require double the daily cost. If you fail by more than 5, they quit your service immediately, possibly becoming hostile.


## Hit Points and Death

Your Hit Points are an abstract measurement of how close you are to taking a fatal blow in combat.


### Game Difficulty Mode

Before anything related to Hit Points is determined in your game, your 'Smith must first determine the current adventure's **Game Difficulty Mode**. This mainly just sets the expectations for what happens when a character reaches Zero hit points. The three difficulty modes are:

* **HARDCORE** aka "Classic" aka "Tournament" mode. Upon reaching Zero HP, your character dies. This is best for one-shots, conventions, and other such meat-grinder experiences.
* **ADVENTURE** aka "Campaign" mode. Upon reaching zero, you're dying but still in the fight, and you burn CON until you die. CON can only be restored magically. This is good for short campaigns and stories where the characters get to suffer a little longer.
* **EXCITEMENT** aka "Safety" mode. As Adventure mode, but CON can also be restored through downtime rest. This is good for groups that want to tell a much longer story, or just want a bit more molly-coddling.


### Determining Your Starting Hit Points

Your character's starting HP at level 1 is equal to the maximum of their Hit Die, modified by their CON mod, with a minimum of 1 HP.


### Improving Your Hit Points

The primary method of long term character HP improvement is via increasing your experience level. Whenever you Level Up, you can increase your HP Max by a random amount. This is further explained in the "Experience" section, further above.


### Temporary Hit Points

Some spells or other effects can give you temporary additional hit points. Track these separate from your actual HPs. When you take damage, first subtract the damage from your temporary HPs, until that amount is depleted. Excess and further damage then comes out of your actual HPs.

When temporary HPs expire, you *do not* have to "pay them back" in any fashion, unless the effect otherwise explicitly specifies.


### Dealing Damage

Whenever you would connect with a damaging attack or effect, roll the given amount of damage and apply it to your target, who "takes" said damage (see below).

Your base damage with all weapons is equal to your Class Hit Die. Some weapons may have special modifiers to this, however. Dwarves, Half-ogres, and Fighters have special damage rules with Two-Handed weapons (see classes for details).

Your base damage with spells and other effects is determined by those individual effects.


### Taking Damage

Whenever you would "take" damage from an attack or effect, subtract the incoming amount from your current Hit Point total. If the newly-adjusted amount is greater than Zero, then your character is still up and active without further modification (unless otherwise specified).

If the newly-adjusted total is less than zero, you are likely dead, or dying, depending on the adventure's Difficulty Mode. See "Zero Hit Points" further below.


### Zero Hit Points

What happens at Zero Hit Points depends on the game's selected Difficulty Mode.


#### HARDCORE Mode

In Hardcore mode, when your adventurer reaches zero hit points, they are dead. See Character Death, further below.


#### ADVENTURE Mode

In Adventure mode, when your adventurer is reduced to 0 Hit Points, they're not dead... *not yet*. First, any damage taken in excess of what would be needed to drop you to Zero hit points is immediately taken out of your CON score. This loss is *permanent* until magically restored (see below). Now if *that* reduces you to 0 CON, *then* you're dead. See the "Death" section for how to proceed.

If you've still got CON score left after over, then you're still up! But you're now getting badly wounded, and each breath you take brings you one step closer to the doorway to the afterlife. On your turn, you can choose one of the following two options:

* Lay Down and Call for Help
* Fight On!

If you choose to **Lay Down**, you drop to the ground prone. On this round and every round following it until you are healed, you must make a Death save. If you fail, you take an immediate point of permanent CON loss. If this drops you to Zero, you're dead. See the Death subsection, further below.

If you choose to **Fight On**, you can take an action as normal! Resolve it, and at the end of your action you immediately take 1d4 permanent CON damage, no save allowed. If this drops you to Zero, you're dead. Repeat for each turn that you continue to Fight on.

*In either case,* while your HP is zero, any further damage you may take from additional attacks or effects targeting you comes directly out of your CON score. Once your CON reaches Zero, you are Dead. See the Character Death subsection, further below.

If your CON has been permanently reduced due to taking damage below zero HP, then the only way to restore it is through advanced medical technology of 21st century or later (good luck finding that in your dirty-ass dungeon), or instead via a special alternate use of the Level 4 Cleric Spell *Cure Serious Wounds* spell (or similar potion or scroll). See the Magic Section for specific spell details.


#### EXCITEMENT Mode

Excitement Mode is identical to Adventure mode, with the following update to recovering lost CON:

In addition to magical recovery, lost points of CON can be restored through extended character rest. After returning to town, you can choose to stick around and take an extended rest. For each week of downtime, your character restores 1 point of lost CON.

The financial cost for this rest is based on the character's social class (SOC). The character must be able to spend an amount of coins equal to their SOC Stat score every day of this recovery. This is exciting, right?

Given that this could lay your character out for an extended amount of time, this is a prime opportunity to roll up a new fill-in character to join the rest of your party in their ongoing adventures during the rest period.


### Healing Lost Hit Points

Healing lost hit points can be done in the following methods:

* **Spell Magic:** Several spells restore lost HPs, with results based on the spell. Clerics as such are valuable party members.
* **Healing Potions:** These items are purchasable at most cities, and are detailed in the Equipment section of this document.
* **Camp Actions:** Special Camp-specific Actions can allow characters to restore some of their lost HPs.
* **Returning to Town:** Characters are restored to full HP maximum upon Returning to Town.
* **Healing Skills and Backgrounds:** Some skills and character backgrounds may imply professional healing abilities. At the Smith's discretion, these can be used to restore one or more hit points, provided appropriate equipment is on hand and available.


### Character Death

Barring the existence and availability of resurrection magic, this is a permanent state of being. Time to roll up a new hero and feed them to the dungeon.

At the time of a character's death, there's a chance that some or all of their loot will also be destroyed. See below.


#### Loot Survival

When a character dies in a dungeon, there's a chance that some or all of their gear and loot might also be destroyed with them. Many lucky groups have salvaged all kinds of sweet loot from the bodies of their fallen comrades. Other more unlucky groups can find themselves trapped and hopeless when crucial plot-specific items were destroyed along with their dead friends. Such is the way of HAMMERCRAWL!

To determine this, at the time of the character's death their player must make a Luck save for each and every Worn, Equipped, and Carried item, applying the now-dead character's Luck Save mod. For most items, the target is 10. For bags, make only one roll for the entire bag, using its "Save" score as the target.

If an item fails its save, cross through it, for it is destroyed. If a bag fails, cross through it *and* all of its contents, for they are all destroyed. On the plus side, if a bag makes its save, there is no need to roll for any of its contents, as they all survive automatically.


## Leveling Up (ref)

See "Experience"


## Light and Darkness

As none of the base classes in HAMMERCRAWL! can see in the dark, having a source of light is crucial to successful dungeon delving. How can you expect to explore a dungeon and stay alive if you can't see?! In addition to all the standard role-playing needs that light serves in a game like this, the special meta-action of HAMMERCRAWL! are directly affected by it as well. For one you, absolutely require at least one light source in order to Camp, and if you try and Explore without light then you add potentially several additional dangerous Black Dice to the 'Smith's Divining Pool.


### Types of Lighting

There are five types of lighting:

* **Darkness:** Complete loss of visual perception, must rely on other senses if available. See deeper description further below.
* **Weak Light:** Good enough for basic visibility, but apply disadvantage to deeper visual perception-based rolls at the 'Smith's discretion.
* **Strong Light:** Good light for human vision, no light-specific penalties applied.
* **Blinding Light:** Without adequate eye protection, suffer disadvantage to visual perception-based rolls. Continued exposure can lead to temporary or even permanent loss of vision at the 'Smith's discretion.


### Common Light Sources

Most adventuring parties in HAMMERCRAWL! have access to the following "common" sources of light:

* **Candle:** Lasts 6 Beats, giving a 5-foot radius of weak light
* **Torch:** Lasts 6 Beats (1 hour), giving a 20-foot radius of weak light
* **Lantern w/ 1 flask of oil:** Lasts 24 Beats (4 hours), giving a 40-foot radius of weak light
* **Light Spell (requires spellcasting):** Lasts 6 Beats (+1/caster level), giving a 15-foot radius of strong light


### Combining/Canceling Light Sources

Some of the following effects may occur in your games:

* **Weak Light + Weak Light = Strong Light:** If two or more weak light sources are combines (such as two lit torches, for example), the result is a strong light in the overlapping space.
* **Any Light + Regular Darkness = Regular Light:** Light of any kind introduced to darkness temporarily cancels that darkness. This should be pretty obvious.
* **Magical Darkness + Regular Light = Magical Darkness:** Magical darkness is stronger than any regular light source.
* **Magical Darkness + Magical Light = Double Negation:** Magical Darkness and Magical Light negate each other out of existence. If either side has a Continual effect, it returns to existence once the other effect has expired, but if both have the Continual effect then both are permanently negated. After negation, whatever regular lighting that previously existed returns to effect.

I must note, however, that these are getting super nitpicky, so you may wish to just ignore this in your games and move the hell on with play.


### Effects of Darkness

When a character is acting under the effects of darkness, the following mechanics apply:

* Their Combat Attack Dice pool is reduced by one. If this reduces it to Zero, they cannot effectively attack.
* They can not perform Critical Hits on natural rolls of 20. Such rolls are treated as normal 20s instead, without the usual double damage effect.
* Their Damage Hit Die is treated as one die size lower than it would normally be.
* They roll with Disadvantage on Skill rolls, Area Saves.
* They roll with double Disadvantage on all rolls involving visual perception (if the 'Smith even allows them at all).

As you can see, being in complete darkness is very much Not Good, so you are advised to keep fresh light sources handy at all times.


## Magic (ref)

Given the depth of magical ways, the magic rules have their own separate chapter. See "Magic and Spellcasting" further below.


## Mapping

TBD


## Morale

The player characters themselves are as brave as their players choose them to be. Their allies and henchpersons, however, are usually decidedly less so. The same goes for many enemies that the adventurers beat on, who might come to the realization that cowering or even running away are better choices than fighting to the death against superior opponents.

When a NPC that *is not* under the leadership or employ of a player character faces a life-threatening situation, the 'Smith may require it to make a Morale check. This is done by rolling a standard Rally Save against a Target determined by comparing the NPC's HD Tier against the threat's HD Tier (see the "Saving Throws" section, below).

If no mechanical basis of comparison is immediately apparent, just eyeball the Target as follows:

* Minor Threat: 9
* Major Threat: 15
* OMGWTFBBQRUN: 21

If the NPC passes the Save, they grit their teeth and fight on! If they fail, they either freeze in panic, cower in their boots, wet themselves, and/or run screaming immediately (up to the 'Smith based on the feel of the moment).

NPCs that are under the leadership of a player character are called "Hirelings" and handle morale checks different. See the "Hirelings and Henchmen" section, above.


## Party Meta-Actions

The HAMMERCRAWL! rules add a set of special meta-actions to the mix, which the Party Leader can call upon to move the game forward. There are three of these:

* **Camp** lets the party recover some resources by taking an hour of rest.
* **Explore** moves the party to the next room or "node" of the dungeon.
* **Return to Town** sends the party out of the dungeon to their staging town, to spend loot and level up.


### Party Action: Camp

The party Leader can choose to take a Camp Action at any location deemed a **Safe Haven**. These are discovered when the Hammersmith announces them as such, usually through the roll of net Falcons in the Divining Pool. This requires Light, Rations, and potentially a Bedroll, however. The Party Leader can activate a Camp action at any time while in a Safe Haven, provided the party has the required resources below:

* **Time:** The action takes a minimum of 6 Beats (1 hour; light is required and spent accordingly unless the *entire* party can somehow see in the dark)
* **Food:** Each character must consume 1 Ration

First, each character in the party gets the following action for free:

* **Cleric, Magic-User:** Re-memorize 1 daily spell. **This requires access to an appropriate spellbook**.
* **Dwarf, Fighter, Halfling, Half-ogre, and Thief:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs. **This requires a Bedroll or suitable substitute**.
* **Elf:** Pick either of the above two options, provided suitable gear is available.

Then, each player gets to pick one additional Camp Action to perform now:

* **Rest:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs (or the second half, if doubling up from the free action above). **Requires a Bedroll and Food:** Choosing this action consumes one additional Ration, and requires an available Bedroll or suitable substitute.
* **Re-Memorize:** Recover one previously-spent daily spell use per character level. **This requires an appropriate spellbook**
* **Craft Ammo:** Add 2d4 normal arrows for your bow/crossbow, or collect as many stones for your sling.
* **Level up!:** If the hero has enough XP to reach the next level, they can apply the effects of that level as a Camp Action. Follow the core process for Leveling Up. Note that it does not heal existing HP loss or restore used spells or abilities (those are separate Camp Actions, above).
* **Stand Watch:** Add a Blue Die to the next room explored, and -1 to Smith's camp encounter roll (below).
* **Scout Ahead:** Roll Search (or other system-appropriate check). If successful, add one Yellow die to next 1d4 new rooms explored. If failed, add that many Black dice instead.

Next, **The Hammersmith Checks for Camp Encounters:** Roll 1d6, -1 for each person on watch, and + the current Dungeon Level.

If total is 6+, an encounter happens while the party is camping! Roll as usual to generate a standard encounter, using the Divining Pool as if an Explore action had occurred. Apply any bonus color dice from camp actions to this roll. If none of the PCs chose to Stand Watch, then they are also surprised!

If an encounter occurs during camp, the Time and Rations are still spent, and all other chosen Camp Actions still occur. Resolve them before beginning the encounter's initiative checks.

**Finally, reset the Risk and Reward Dice totals.** After camping, all accrued Risk and Reward dice are pulled from the Pool, their count resetting to Zero for the next Explore action.


### Party Action: Explore

Each dungeon will likely consist of multiple levels, with many rooms among them. Each room can contain numerous horrible dangers, but also a good chance at wondrous loot as well. Moving from room to room requires exploration, which invites danger but also creates opportunity for new treasures and rewards!

In order to continue exploring the Dungeon, your party leader must tell the 'Smith' that your group is moving on to the next Room - be sure to discuss tactics and approaches before you move! Moving to the next room in this fashion initiates the **Explore Action** and tells the 'Smith' that it's time to roll the dungeon die and the Divining Pool. The rules for divining the Explore Action are in the Hammersmith's section of the rules.

**TIME:** The Explore action requires a minimum of 1 Beat of time, so have light sources ready!


### Party Action: Return to Town

When the heroes finally return to town (which likely involves first backtracking through the dungeon to their original exit), the following happens, in order:

1. Restore all HP totals to Max, and relearn daily Spells and Powers.
2. The party divides up their loot and plunder as they see fit.
3. Each player can choose to spend any amount of their loot to acquire better goods at the DM's allowance. This could take time, though, so you might want to skip it in Con and One-Shot games.
4. Leftover party loot can now be converted to XP. For every 1000 coins worth of unspent loot they choose to convert, the entire surviving party gains 1 XP. Loot converted in this fashion is lost, and cannot be used to purchase goods.
5. If anyone has enough XP to level up, they follow the Leveling Up process.
6. Role-play any town encounters or experiences you wish.
7. Return to the Dungeons!

See "Encounters"


## Saving Throws

You will frequently be asked to make a "saving throw" in order to resist affects from spells, traps, and many other dangers. The Hammersmith will tell you when you need to make a Save, and which of the following Six categories that save falls under:

* Area: Dodges and Large Area Effect Attacks
* Death: Insta-Kills and Bleeding Out
* Mind: Mental Debilitations
* Body: Physical Debilitations
* Luck: Fate and Fortune
* Rally: Leadership and Morale

When it's time to make the check, roll 1d20 and add your relevant modifier based on your class and stats. The target number for your roll is based on the "Tier" of power of the source effect, determined by comparing the source's relevant power tier to your character's current experience tier:

| Source Tier is…    | Target |
|--------------------|--------|
| Two or more Lower  | 9      |
| One Lower          | 12     |
| Equal              | 15     |
| One Higher         | 18     |
| Two or more Higher | 21     |

For example, a 2nd level Adventurer (Tier 1) saving against the magical fear effect of a 7th level Monster (Tier 3) would have to roll an 18 or higher, due to the differences in their tiers.


## Searching for Hidden Secrets

Adventurers can search for clues and hidden secrets in the dungeon by spending time in active investigation. A character can search a single 10 x 10 area in a minimum one Beat of time, and of course the party can split up to cover more ground in larger areas by searching simultaneously. Characters can spend longer searching, and increase their chances of success.

When one or more characters are searching, the Hammersmith asks how many characters (if any) are searching together, and how long they intend to spend searching. After the time stated, the 'Smith secretly rolls to see if they found anything that may have been hidden in their area. Each character searching has a cumulative 1 in 6 chance of finding a hidden secret in the area per Beat spent searching. If they work together, their efforts are combined. For example, two characters who spend two Beats together searching the same area have a 4 in 6 chance of finding a hidden secret. If the combined time and efforts push the chance to 6 in 6 or more, the characters automatically find the secret(s) after the allotted amount of time.

Note that a successful search result still won't find any hidden secrets if there are none there to find in the first place. And also note that discovering the *existence* of the secret doesn't necessarily inform the characters how to *access* that secret, either. That may require additional detailed, creative, and hands-on storytelling, role-playing, and scene exploration.


### Searching for Traps (ref)

Searching for Traps is handled by the Thief Skill. See Thief Skills, particularly "Trap-Finding."


## Skills

All characters in HAMMERCRAWL! begin play with a variety of both explicit and assumed skills. Explicit skills include the four free random skills that each character gets at creation. Assumed skills are anything that one could reasonably assume the character has ability in due to their background and their class. Fighters and Elves are pretty athletic, obviously, while former Bankers and Accountants are assumed to know math and finances.

The Hammersmith is heavily encouraged to involve these skills as ways to move things along and give out information without relying upon the dice. The *vast* majority of the time, skills should be involved in play as purely narrative flavor. If a Banker is looking over a found ledger of an evil kingdom's accounts, they do not need to roll for anything, and the Hammersmith will give them special information that only they can glean from it. Similarly, a physically fit Elf adventurer should not need to make a check to climb a tree, leap a fence, or rappel down a ravine with proper tooling. In most cases, the 'Smith is encouraged to simply "give it to them" when they clearly have the right skill or assumed background for the situation.

Still, the Hammersmith may *occasionally* feel that a roll of some sort should still be somehow involved, for behind the scenes reasons. Perhaps the aforementioned ledger is encoded in a strange cryptic cypher, or maybe the Elf is trying to climb that tree in the middle of an earthquake!

In such cases, the Hammersmith may call for a test. The player will need to roll a d20 and add the modifier of whichever stat the 'Smith deems most appropriate. If the character has either an explicit or assumed skill in the matter, their target is 10. If not, their target is 15. And if it's something that the 'Smith deems to be vastly out of that character's repertoire of ability, the target is 20.

Thief skills are special, and detailed in the "Thief Skills" section below.


## Spells and Spellcasting (ref)

Given the mechanical depth of the magical arts, the magic rules have their own separate chapter. See "Magic and Spellcasting" further below.


## Thief Skills (ref)

Thieves (and to a lesser extent Halflings) have access to special skills which always require rolls. To attempt a Thief Skill, the player must first have the skill in question as a class feature. These rolls are performed by rolling a d20, adding the associated Stat Mod for the skill being tested, and comparing it to a target number. The target number is determined by comparing the Thief's experience Tier to the Tier of the current Dungeon Level, which is based on the level Boss's HD (see Tiers, further below).

If the resulting modified total equals or exceeds the target number, the check succeeds. Otherwise, the check fails. Each skill has its own details on the results of success and failure.

| Dungeon Level Tier is… | Thiefskill Target |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Two or more Lower      | 9                 |
| One Lower              | 12                |
| Equal                  | 15                |
| One Higher             | 18                |
| Two or more Higher     | 21                |

**Magical Evolution:** Thieves (and only thieves) eventually master their skills to the point that they go beyond the mundane world with in their scope. At their 9th experience level, all of a Thief's special Thiefskills evolve to affect both the mundane and the magical. When attempting to affect magical targets, the thief must roll with a Disadvantage. In each of the skill descriptions below, the "Magical Evolution" sections detail these new abilities.



### Appraise & Identify (INT)

This skill allows a Thief to quickly determine an accurate selling value for any piece of loot, as well as to know important historical facts about it.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a Thief can use this skill to identify magical properties of an item. Only one attempt is allowed per item. A success tells the thief one magical property, if any, but not how many more may remain undiscovered. If there are no magical properties, a success will impart this knowledge. Upon failure, the 'Smith is free to feed the thief false information.


### Break & Enter (DEX)

This is the Thief's ability to bypass security features and break into places they're not supposed to be. The most common uses are to bypass locks and disable traps, but other creative uses are also encouraged. Not that one must first *detect* a trap before one can attempt to disable it...

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can use this skill to bypass magical security measures, such as wizard locks and magical traps.


### Climb & Leap (STR)

Roll this skill when facing a climbing or leaping challenge that would stymie even a well-prepared adventurer. No rope required, in most cases - thieves are just that bloody good at this. However, exceptionally-prepared thieves with excellent tools may receive an advantage, at the 'Smith's discretion.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can use this skill to climb magical walls and barriers. If these obstacles cause damage, the thief still takes said damage as normal as they climb.


### Find & Seek (WIS)

This skill allows a thief to find hidden nouns in the game world. They can follow the tracks of people, locate hidden rooms and secret doors, and detect concealed traps.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can use this skill to detect magical concealment as well. This doesn't allow the thief to directly break said magical concealment, but it does let the thief know what kind is being used, and how powerful it is.


### Forge & Decipher (INT)

This skill allows a thief to both decipher unknown texts, and forge texts for purposes of deceit.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can attempt to use this skill as a *Read Magic* spell, allowing them to cast scrolls. Failure on this may result in unintended consequences, at the 'Smith's discretion.


### Hide & Sneak (DEX)

This skill does what it says: it allows the Thief to hide and sneak around. This skill is effective for bypassing the scrutiny of guards, and for getting into place to set up Stabbity attacks. Being hidden may allow numerous advantages, at the 'Smith's discretion. All you need is a little bit of shadow, and something to hide behind...

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, the Thief is so good at being sneaky that they can fool magical detection. This can allow them to hide in plain sight as if invisible, or to fool spells that locate specific people, and so on. The usage of this is largely at the 'Smith's discretion.


### Lie & Cheat (CHA)

This skill allows a thief to tell amazingly convincing lies, and also to successfully cheat at every game and deal possible. Anyone can tell a lie or cheat at cards, but thieves are so good they can con the most skilled of investigators, and cheat at the most rigged game.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief's lies can sometimes even bypass magical scrutiny or defenses. This allows them to fool Truth spells, for instance, or to undermine magical conditioning or charms.


### Snatch & Grab (DEX)

This skill allows a thief to perform acts of complicated manual dexterity, such as sleight of hand and picking pockets.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a Thief can perform truly impossible acts with this skill, such as stealing an item too far away to reach ("It just leapt into my hand!"), stealing the straps out from inside an opponent's worn armor, and so on. The applications of this are up to the imagination of the player, and the discretion of the 'Smith.









## Tiers

A number of effects in the game use the "Tier" mechanic as a rough relative comparison of power between two or more entities within the fiction. For example, gaining XP from challenges is determined by the relative tiers of the Party and their Opponents, and similarly the targets for Saving Throws against harmful effects are based on Tier comparison.

**Eyeballing Tier:** Typically a game item's "tier" is equal to one-third (round UP) that game item's associated "level." For Player Characters, this is based on XP level. For Monsters, it's their number of Hit Dice. Using this formula it's pretty simple to eyeball tier differences on the fly. Otherwise, refer to the table below:

| Tier | XP/HD Levels | Adventurer Rank         | Monster Rank    | Treasure?          |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 0            | Common Non-Adventurer   | Dungeon Fodder  | Pocket Oddities    |
| 1    | 1-3          | Skilled Vagabond        | Nuisance        | Money              |
| 2    | 4-6          | Professional Adventurer | Monster         | Gem/Art            |
| 3    | 7-9          | Local Hero              | Serious Danger  | Minor Magic Item   |
| 4    | 10-12        | Reknowned Hero          | Critical Threat | Major Magic Item   |
| 5    | 13-15        | Living Legend           | Legendary Foe   | Legendary Artifact |
| 6    | 16+          | N/A                     | Ultimate Threat | Divine Relic       |

Note that player characters' levels are capped at 15, and as such an adventurer's personal experience Tier will never rise above 5. Monsters and Treasures have one tier higher, because there is always something more powerful than even the greatest of heroes...


### Dungeon Level Tiers

Dungeon levels have tiers too! A Dungeon Level's Tier rank is derived from the HD total of the strongest monster on that level - aka the "Boss" of that Dungeon Level. Again, the formula is 1/3 (rounded up) the HD of the monster. Thus a Dungeon Level whose Boss has 10HD (a Tier 4 monster) would be a Tier 4 Dungeon Level.


## Timekeeping

1 Round = ~10 seconds

1 Minute = ~6 rounds

1 Beat = ~10 minutes = ~60 rounds

1 Hour = ~6 Beats


## Turn Unholy

(work in progress)

The victims must make a Mind Save. The target is determined by comparing their HD/level Tier to the Cleric's tier:

| Cleric's Level Tier is… | Target | Results of Failed Save |
|-------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Two or more Lower       | 6      | Dazed for 1d4 rounds (disadvantage) |
| One Lower               | 9      | Cower in Fear for 1d4 rounds |
| Equal                   | 12     | Flee for 2d4 rounds |
| One Higher              | 15     | Flee for 2d4 rounds, take damage (Xd8) |
| Two or more Higher      | 18     | Destroyed |

Thus an undead foe with HD 9 (tier 3) would roll against a target of 6 when turned by a Cleric of 2nd level (tier 1).

Success means the targets are not affected. With a failed save, the targets are affected as detailed in the third column of the table above, based again on the difference in the cleric's level

The results are explained further below:

**Dazed:** The victim is dazed for the stated duration, suffering disadvantage on all actions.

**Cower in Fear:** The victim cowers in place paralyzed in fear. The victim loses all of its actions for the stated duration.

**Flee:** The victim must spend its next few rounds doing nothing but fleeing from the Cleric in the most direct and obvious fashion and path.

**Damage:** The victim is deeply hurt by the force of the Cleric's faith. The number of dice of damage is equal to the Cleric's current experience *Tier* (1 - 5).

**Destroyed:** The victim is outright destroyed by the overwhelming power of the Cleric's faith.



# CHAPTER: Combat and Fighting

TBD


## Combat Stats and Details

TBD


## Combat Process

1. Check for Surprise
2. COMBAT ROUNDS
  * Leaders roll Initiative to determine which side goes first.
  * SIDES:
    - Leaders determine who takes first Turn.
    - Afterward, leader determines who takes the next Turn.
    - Repeat until the side has fully acted.
    - If the other side hasn't acted yet, they now get to do so as above.
  * After both sides are complete, if there is still a fight to resolve, return to Initiative.
3. LOOT TIME!


### Surprise

TBD


### Combat Rounds

A combat round is roughly ten (10) seconds of action.


### Initiative

At the top of each Round of combat, the designated leader of each side rolls initiative as follows: 1d12 + DEX mod + WIS mod. Highest roll wins initiative. Initiative Ties are resolved in the following order of determination:

1. Most numerous side wins
2. Winner of last initiative wins
3. Roll off

After Initiative is determined, the winning side gets to take all of their actions first, followed by the losing side. In the unusual case of three-plus side competing against each other, each side acts in the order they rolled.

When the players' side acts, the Leader designates who goes first. After that player's action is done, the Leader again designates who goes next. This repeats until everyone has taken a Turn.

When the 'Smith's side acts, they are allowed to choose in what order their minions act, as they act, and resolve them one at a time accordingly.

Once both sides have completed their turns, it is time to roll initiative for a new round of combat. Repeat these rounds until one side is the victor, or another suitable outcome is reached.


### Your Turn

On your turn, you can Move and then Act, or instead Act and then Move. You cannot split that up unless rules specifically tell you otherwise.


#### Moving

Your movement options are as follows:

* **Stay Put:** By standing your ground and not moving, you still get to act afterward in the proper order this round. You additionally enjoy a +1 readiness bonus to any one rolled die (of any size) during that action.
* **Move Near:** You can choose to move no further than your Speed, and still take an action this round.
* **Move Far:** You can choose to rush, moving up to double your Speed. You can not both Move Far and Take an Action in the same round.


#### Taking Actions

TBD


##### Basic Attack Action

TBD


##### Cast Spell Action

TBD


##### Defensive Action

You can choose to dedicate your turn's action to avoiding damage entirely by using a Defensive Action - sometimes called "taking a defensive position."

To do so, you must first wait until the "Misc" phase of your side's combat round, and then declare you are executing a Defensive Action.

Then you must describe how your character is specifically focusing on defense in the current moment.

When done, you are in a Defensive state, and all attacks taken against you *that you can see coming* suffer a Disadvantage die until your next combat turn. Attacks that come from unawares do not suffer this penalty.

This of course consumes your action for the round.


##### Shield Bash Action

The **shield bash** is a special melee attack available to Dwarves and Fighters. *After* rolling all of their attack dice during a melee action, the shield-bearer can choose to declare one of their successful hits as a Shield Bash. The attack does half the rolled damage (round down), and the target must then make a Body Save vs the shield-bearer's attack roll. If failed, the shield-bearer additionally gets a choice of one of the following:

* The target is disarmed, and their weapon knocked beyond immediate melee reach.
* The target is "dazed" until their next action, suffering combat disadvantage.
* The target is knocked to the ground, and the next ally that attacks them gains advantage on one of their dice.

Fighters who Shield Bash as one of their attack dice lose the shield's AC bonus until their next combat turn. Dwarves do not suffer this setback.


##### Swap Gear Action

On your Turn, you can freely swap between any gear that you are holding or carrying in your immediate Personal Inventory. This does not cost an action, but does require it to be your active turn.

For an action, you can swap between held/carried items and items inside your carried Bags. This requires an action, because you have to stop what you're doing, open the bags, dig around in them, and so on.

Wearable items cannot normally be swapped out mid-combat without explicit allowances by the 'Smith.


##### Tactical Action

TBD


##### Tactical Attack

The **Tactical Attack** is a special melee action available to all characters. Clever players may wish to forgo damaging actions in favor of using their attacks to impede their opponents or otherwise create tactical advantages for their team. This includes ideas such as bull rushing, tripping, feinting, and any actual melee attack meant to confound more than to harm. Provided this takes the form of a melee attack, these are resolved in the Melee phase, otherwise resolve them in the Misc. Phase..

These attacks never do damage, but can instead set up temporary advantages and disadvantages. Any character can attempt a tactical attack, although Thieves and Halflings have advantages to them. *After* rolling all of their attack dice during a melee action, a combatant can choose to declare one or more of their dice rolls (not necessarily hits!) as Tactical Attacks. The player must vividly describe the special maneuver they are attempting, and then declare if it is saved by Mind or Body. The save should be fairly obvious: if it's a feint or trick then it's saved by Mind, while shoves and trips and the like are saved by Body.

The target must make the relevant Save. If the attacker was using a special **Tactical Weapon** (such as a bola, whip, blowgun, etc), they make this save with a disadvantage.

If failed, the Hammersmith chooses one of the following based on the description and the beat of the moment:

* The target suffers a disadvantage on their next action
* The next action against the target gains an advantage
* The target loses their next action
* The target is temporarily incapacitated
* Any other effect that seems appropriate

Tactical Actions are great for setting an opportunity for a Thief's Stabbity attack.


### Special Combat Rules

Alphabetized for ease of reference.


#### Critical Hits and Fumbles

If any of your Attack Dice roll a natural 20, you have earned a **Critical Hit** with that die! On a Critical Hit, total your damage dice (based on Hit Die) and all associated bonuses, double that total, and then apply that much damage. Alternately, instead of doubling the damage you can choose to apply a cool narrative or tactical effect, such as pushing your target into a pit, or insulting their lineage so heinously that they cringe in shame (giving your allies advantage against them for the next round).

If any of your Attack Dice roll a natural 1, you have earned a **Fumble!** result with that die.


#### Ranged Attacks

Every missile and thrown weapon in the Gear section is given a Range stat, consisting of two numbers divided by a slash. The first number is the **Effective Range** of that weapon, and the second number is the weapon's **Maximum Range**. Attacks at Effective range are made as normal, while attacks up to the Maximum range suffer a Disadvantage die.


#### Two-Weapon Fighting

In a HAMMERCRAWL! game, any character can choose to wield two weapons at once - this is entirely a matter of narrative description, and players are encouraged to go wild with their imaginations here. Elf Exemplars are the only characters that receive *specific* mechanical bonuses for attempting to do fight in that style.

Particularly generous Hammersmiths may choose to award all characters occasional one-off bonuses for clever use of off-hand tools and weaponry, as long as it is done so in a way that doesn't diminish the value of the Elf's unique ability. Non-Elf characters that wish to tactically employ two-weapon attacks on the regular are encouraged to instead consider incorporate them as description for Tactical Actions (see above).


#### Unarmed Combat

The Hit Die damage rules assume the use of any number of standard weapons. When fighting unarmed, the damage die is reduced by one step (i.e. from 1d8 to 1d6). If the combatant's base Hit Die is d4, then their damage is reduced to 1 point. Getting punched by a wizard is usually more of an annoyance than anything noteworthy.

When fighting unarmed against an armed opponent, prepare for a massive beating. Unarmed combatants have disadvantage on melee attacks against armed opponents, and armed combatants also have advantage on attacks against unarmed opponents. Double whammy.

Note that holding a shield and/or a missile weapon counts as being armed.


## After Combat


### Loot Time!

When combat ends, the survivors gain the might-gained right to loot the bodies of the fallen, both foe and friend alike. This is a divine privilege that extends back to the earliest days of gaming, and is in fact the reason many of us still play these elf games today. Loot gained through feats of martial and magical prowess is the best loot, bar none.



# CHAPTER: Magic and Spellcasting

Elves, Clerics, and Magic-Users (and of course many monsters) have the special ability to cast magical spells. While Clerics have access to a different "divine" spell list than Elves and Magic-Users, unlike most other derivatives of The OG, that is where their spellcasting differences end. Spell lists aside, all spellcasting classes use the same rules for memorizing and casting spells.


## Maintaining Spellbooks

TBD


### Clerics Use Spellbooks Too!

Unlike The OG and most of its derivatives, Clerics in HAMMERCRAWL! require spellbooks too! In opposition to how a lot of other games implement them, Clerics *do not* immediately have access to the entire Clerical spell list upon attaining the requisite experience levels. Instead, Clerics must collect and learn spells exactly as Elves and Magic-users, only their are drawn from Holy Writ. Clerics call their tomes "Prayerbooks" but otherwise follow all the core spellbook rules. Clerical spells care commonly called "prayers" and they can learn from holy scrolls exactly the same as Magic-users learn from wizardly scrolls.

Some more experienced players of The OG may call this change blasphemy, but in play we've found that brand new players at one-shot games find that it makes for a lot more approachable experience when playing a Cleric for the very first time.


### Losing Spellbooks

TBD


## Preparing and Memorizing Spells

Upon the start of a new day, Clerics and Elves are considered to have memorized every spell in their currently-possessed spellbooks for the levels that they are allowed to cast, even newly-discovered ones. Magic-Users (only) are considered to have memorized *every* spell in their spellbooks, regardless of level.

*Whoah now, hold on bro! What the heck?! That's OP, dude!*

Don't worry, fam, I hear you, and beg you to chilly down. Dear Reader, it's important to remember the focus of this game: sit-down, pick-up, meat-grinder dungeon crawling. One of the major roadblocks for brand new players to "Old School" style games is the experience-based barrier of entry to the "fun" classes like Clerics, Magic-Users, and Elves. They clearly get to do all the cool stuff, but for new players without extensive knowledge of daily spell preparation and the entire contents of the Cleric spell list, taking on these classes at the start can be intimidating, and can lead to those new players never coming back to a game they could learn to love. Thus HAMMERCRAWL! takes a simplified approach, aiming to make all spellcasters easier to play for newbies, but still keep them *somewhat* in check.

*Ahem, resuming rules text...*

At the beginning of a new day of adventuring, and following a good long restful session of sleep and morning preparation, a spellcaster is assumed to have memorized every spell currently in their Spellbook.

Spells are usually forgotten upon casting. Spells can be re-memorized by resting or returning to town.


## Casting Spells

You can cast any spell you have memorized. To do so, simply choose the spell and follow the rules of that spell. Many spells won't require the caster to make any dice rolls, although many will have saving throws that the target must make in order to resist the effects.

Upon casting, you forget it for the rest of the day. If you do not wish to forget it, you can instead choose to lose a number of other memorized spells, provided their total level cost is equal to or greater than that of the spell that you just cast.


### On Reversible Spells

Although this game largely draws from the ol' Cyclopedia, there are no "Reversible" Spells in HAMMERCRAWL! Any reversible spells translated from older editions are done so as their two separate component spells. This at least somewhat cuts back on the power of casters, in light of their "cast anything!" abilities.


## Learning New Spells

Spellcasters learn spells through leveling up and also by finding them as loot on scrolls. Each class has its own rules for gaining spells when leveling up.

Whenever a spellcaster acquires a new spell from an external source that is compatible with their spell list, they can transcribe it into their spellbook. If the source is a scroll or other such scrap, the source is destroyed in the process. If the source is another spellbook, the spell remains in the source.


## Spell Lists

This game text does not *yet* have extensive spell lists, but over time it will certainly grow them out. In the meantime, I recommend you use whichever B/X or BECMI compatible spell list that you prefer. I find that the *Dark Dungeons* list is pretty comprehensive, and give it my seal of approved compatibility. In fact, it's the list I default to when I run HAMMERCRAWL!

* **Effect:** The caster identifies if an item is magical, and if so, learns one magical property of the item. If there are more magical properties, the caster is told only that more properties remain, but not how many.

Casting this spell requires the caster to physically handle the item. This may expose them to any curses or other touch-activated enchantments possessed by the item.

## Wait a Sec... What about Level 9 Spells?

Ah, you are an observant one, yes, you will do well in the adventures to come... So you've probably noticed that due to the 15-level limit on characters, and the progression rates for Elves and Magic-Users, there are no opportunities for them to "safely" memorize and cast 9th-Level spells.

Yes. This is intentional. In the world of HAMMERCRAWL! such spells are legendary creations of the greatest (and most insane) ancient wizards. The Elves refuse to touch them, for fear of the ways they warp the nature of the world and befoul the wellsprings of life. Only human Magic-Users can ever learn them, and even then they can never "safely" cast them due to the restrictions on leveling and the nature of their Highcasting ability.

As for how to find them? Well, dear adventurer, that's why you must always go as deep into the dungeon as possible, to find the ancient madness that lurks beneath...
