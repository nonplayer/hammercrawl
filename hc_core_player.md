This document serves as a Player's guide to staying alive during the HAMMERCRAWL! process.

# CHARACTER MANAGEMENT!

For a true HAMMERCRAWL! experience, the DM will pre-gen 50 or so characters in advance, and set out a stack on the table, face-down.

## Your First Character

Youngest player at the table draws first! Draw Three characters from the stack, pick one. Put the other two face down on the TOP. Repeat until everyone has one character. The LAST person puts their two rejects on the BOTTOM of the stack.

Newcomer to the table? Draw three, pick one, put the others on the BOTTOM!

Play this character until they die!

### Naming Your Character

We've discovered that the _absolute most_ fun is had by having other players name your character. So once you've drawn up your random character, pass them to the left, right, or anywhere really, and have a different player give them a name.

## Who is Party Leader?

One character must be responsible for relaying to the DM the party's official plans. With the initial group selected, the players must decide on the starting Leader of their party.

## Your Character's Inevitable Demise

When you die, your gear becomes party loot. Each item has a 50% (use a d6) chance of being made worthless and useless by your death, however!

Draw a new character from the pile! You arrive either one Turn or one Round later, whichever makes more sense or seems more exciting.

For added fun. draw a tombstone on the back of your character sheet, and give the character a fitting epitaph.

If the dead character was party leader, the group needs to elect a new leader! If this is instantaneous, then move on. However if there is any debate or argument on the role, **it takes one turn of game time** - mark off those lights!

## Don't forget Food and Lights!

Before you head off on your trek, you should make special note that Food and Lights are extremely important to survival in the HAMMERCRAWL! experience. Dungeons are dark and scary places, and most characters can't see in the dark. Without light, you can't act, nor can you camp! Similarly, Food is required in order to camp as well. No food? No camp action. Camping in this system is an *extremely* beneficial resource for the party, so be sure to manage your light and food accordingly!

To better keep track of your light sources, I highly recommend making use of the awesome custom [Torch Cards][] from Dyson Logos. There are lanterns there too! They make great tools for tracking the countdown of lights.

## Managing Loot and XP

The characters will gain XP from encounters they defeat, and hopefully loot as well. XP earned from encounters is immediately applied to the character sheet.

Using some traditional old school game rules, monetary loot also counts as XP - but in HAMMERCRAWL!, that XP is only applied *after* the heroes make it back to town with the loot. So when loot is acquired, write down the loot and its value, but do not count it as XP just yet. Heroes can also convert a fraction of the loot to XP as a Camp Action, but this wastes the vast majority of it.


## USING SKILLS!

Skills are handled as one would expect in the base game being played. Since HAMMERCRAWL! is written primarily with "old school" games in mind, this means that the method expects the same kind of old school mentalities to apply when using "skills" in play.

If you are new to this concept, I recommend starting with the ["Quick Primer for Old School Gaming"](http://www.lulu.com/items/volume_63/3019000/3019374/1/print/3019374.pdf) as a good introductory read.

In short, in "old school" style play, the characters are all assumed to be able to do a great number of things that aren't otherwise specifically written on their character sheets, *provided* they have a reasonable amount of time to do so. For just a few examples, given a low-stress situation (as in "not being actively stabbed by murder trees and melted by acid goblins") and appropriate time to accomplish, the following assumptions can be made:

* Fighters and Thieves can climb a wall or barrier with assumed handholds.
* Wizards and Priests can decipher ancient tomes through extended study.
* A character from a woodsman background can tell if a plant is poisonous or not.
* Anyone unencumbered and without clanky bits can walk slowly and silently for a bit.
* ...and so on

Again, these are just some basic examples of assumptions that can be made. When there is a question of complexity and/or added danger, use one or more (or all!) of the following basic guidelines:

#### Is time a factor worth considering in this moment?

If so, let them perform the task without a roll, but let them know it takes one or more turns of time to accomplish. This can diminish light sources and spell durations, and also affect the exploration dice pools!

#### Is there a chance of a dangerous complication?

This includes things such as "they might hurt themselves" or such. If so, incorporate a basic Ability Check (d20 roll-under). Either way they succeed at the task, but with a failed roll they also suffer a setback, such as:

* HP loss (1 to 1d4 points maybe)
* Equipment loss
* Injury or such resulting in Temporary penalty to near-future die rolls
* an added challenge die to the next exploration pool
* alerting nearby enemies
* some other appropriate environmental response

#### Is there a chance of failure?

This one's a tough call, because again, these are supposed to be capable adventurers. If you truly feel that the feat is a tough enough that they might not succeed, first let them know this in your own preferred DM narrative way. Try to encourage them to offer new strategies to overcome the task, fall-back plans, or complete reassessment of the situation.

If they still persist, as above have them roll an associated ability check. With a failed roll, they both fail the task _and_ suffer some complication from above. Sucks, but they knew the risks before they rolled!

### "Thief Skills"

**However**, certain characters (Thieves, Specialists, etc) get very specific skills written down on their character sheets. The general approach to these skills is to only require them to be rolled against when the situation seems otherwise impossible, when the odds are visibly and obviously stacked against them. Each Thief skill has built into it the assumption that something really bad might happen if it fails. If you're not willing to make that bad thing happen, then what's the point of making the thief roll in the first place?

### Other Skills (Proficiencies, etc)

If your flavor of game has skill proficiencies built into it for all characters, the assumption here is that simply *having* the skill in the first place means that you can just do it most of the time, no roll needed. You would only need to roll for those skills when you wanted or needed to do something truly spectacular with them.


# MOVING ONWARD! (The Explore Action)

Each Dungeon Die or Card represents one room of the Dungeon. There will likely be many rooms, and multiple levels of them! Each room can contain numerous horrible dangers, but also a good chance at wondrous loot as well!

In order to continue exploring the Dungeon, your party leader must tell the DM that your group is moving on to the next Room - be sure to discuss tactics and approaches before you move! Moving to the next room in this fashion initiates the **Explore Action** and tells the DM that it's time to roll the dungeon die and the Divining Pool. The rules for divining the Explore Action are in the DM section of this document (further above). **NOTE** that the Explore action requires a minimum of 1 turn of time, so have light sources ready!


## FIGHTING THINGS! (Combat Rounds)

Combat flows as normal for the base game's rules. HAMMERCRAWL! adds the following new special action(s):

* **Loot Fallen Ally**

### New Personal Action: Loot Fallen Ally

During active combat, a character can take any one readily-accessible item from a fallen ally as an action. Any more in-depth looting must wait until the action is over and the danger clear.

*After* combat, multiple PCs may wish to loot their ally at the same time. Handle this as a special kind initiative. Roll off as usual, and then on their turn a PC may take either one specific item or 1d4 random items.

Money loot from fallen allies is always split evenly among the survivors, unless they otherwise work something else out among themselves.


## CAMPING! (The Camp Action)

The party Leader can choose to take a Camp Action at any location deemed a **Safe Haven**. These are discovered when the DM announces them as such, usually through the roll of net Falcons in the Divining Pool. This requires Light and Rations, however.

To take a Camp Action

**TIME:** 6 Turns (1 hour; light is required unless the *entire* party can see in the dark)

**REQUIRES:** 1 Ration Each (expended)

First, **EACH CHARACTER DOES THE FOLLOWING FOR FREE:** (based on _Dark Dungeons_ character classes)

* **Cleric, Magic-User:** Re-memorize 1 daily spell.
* **Dwarf, Fighter, Halfling, Mystic, and Thief:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs.
* **Elf:** Either re-memorize 1 daily spell *or* recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs.

*System Note:* If using a different system, adjust accordingly, giving primary spellcasters a spell back, and hybrids a choice.

Then, **EACH PLAYER PICKS ONE** additional camp action:

* **Rest:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs (or the second half, if doubling up from the free action above), but also use one additional Ration.
* **Re-Memorize:** Recover one previously-spent daily spell use per character level.
* **Invest:** Convert one-fourth (rounded up) of their current financial loot value to immediate character XP (1GP = 1XP exchange), marking that loot off of the character sheet. Leveling up requires a separate action, however...
* **Craft Ammo:** Add 2d4 normal arrows for your bow/crossbow, or collect as many stones for your sling.
* **Level up!:** If the hero has enough XP to reach the next level, they can apply the effects of that level as a Camp Action. This adds a Hit Die, as well as any other new-level bonuses. Note that it does not heal existing HP loss or restore used spells or abilities (those are separate Camp Actions, above).
* **Stand Watch:** Add a Green Die to the next room explored, and -1 to GM's camp encounter roll (below).
* **Scout Ahead:** Roll Search (or other system-appropriate check). If successful, add one Yellow die to next 1d4 new rooms explored. If failed, add Black dice instead.

Finally, **GM ROLLS 1d6:**

* Subtract 1 for each party member Standing Watch
* Add the current Dungeon Level

If total is 6+, an encounter happens while they camp! Roll as usual to generate a standard encounter. If none of the PCs chose to Stand Watch, then they are also surprised!

If an encounter occurs during camp, the Time and Rations are still spent, and all other chosen Camp Actions still occur. Resolve them before beginning the encounter initiative checks.


## RETURNING HOME! (The Town Action)

When the heroes finally return to town (which likely involves backtracking through the dungeon to their original exit), the following happens, in order:

* Restore HP to Max, and relearn daily Spells and Powers.
* OPTIONAL: Each player can choose to spend any amount of their loot to acquire better goods at the DM's allowance. This could take time, though, so you might want to skip it in Con and One-Shot games. 
* If their loot value is enough to level them up, apply just enough to level them up and discard the rest as having been spent on R&R and upkeep.
* Apply any effects of character leveling.
* If their loot value is not enough to level them up, apply half of it as XP and discard the rest as having been spent on R&R and upkeep. You shouldn't have left the dungeon so soon!
* Restore their standard starting equipment list to full original capacity.
* Return to the Dungeon!
