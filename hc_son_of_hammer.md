# Extend Your Dungeon Crawl

It's a common occurrence, you know: designers house-ruling the games that they themselves wrote. It happens so often that when you play a demo game run by that game's designer, nine times out of ten you're playing with their own unpublished house rules already. What makes it even funnier in this case is that HAMMERCRAWL! itself is really just my own assembled house rules for *other* games as it is. House rules for house rules, when will the madness end?!

This document contains my own extended "house rules" for the core HAMMERCRAWL! game engine. Some of these *could* have been considered basic enough to include in the core document, but in the spirit of keeping that game more or less "classic" in feel, I moved them here instead.

What you'll find within:

* New Alternate Classes and Options
* *Near-constant* beta-quality updates to the content

#### Goblin Acrobat Trio (Hybrid, alternate Halfling Burglar)

Traveling goblin acrobats are an increasingly common spectacle in the frontier lands, and they are even just now starting to occasionally make their way to the bigger cities of the Civilised Lands. Your character is actually *three* such skilled acrobats, for while a single goblin may be too weak and unmotivated to be an adventurer, they can be much more capable in numbers.

* **Prime Stats:** DEX
* **Hit Dice:** 1d4 and Special (See below)
* **Attack Rank:** C: You add 1/3 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 20
* **Saving Throws:**

  - **Bad:** Mind, Body
* **Gear Restrictions:** ???
* **Bonus Languages:** Goblin
* **Bonus Equipment:** A long hooded cloak, three Goblin Sticks, one Goblin Bag.

**SPECIAL Creation Notes:** A Goblin Acrobat Trio is actually *three* (3) goblins that work together as a team. This creates a whole new range of role-playing possibilities, and also requires a bit of modification to the character creation and management process.

* **Stat Rolls:** Each of the three goblins rolls a single 1d6 for each of its six stats. Assign the highest to DEX, and then the rest in order of their rolls. It helps to write them in a 3 columns by 6 rows grid.
* **Basic Actions:** The goblins can act together or separately. An individual goblin uses its own low base stats (and likewise low stat mods). When they work together, they combine their stats directly and then use the combined totals to determine the final derived mods.
* **Hit Dice, Hit Points, and Death:** The Trio's base HD is a d4, and their combined Hit Points are modified by the final derived CON mod. This total applies whether they are together or separated, and covers the entire Trio at once.
* **Combat Actions:** On their Combat turn, the Trio gets only a single action

**Goblin Sticks:** A Goblin Stick looks like a simple, frail, 1-foot-long stick, carved with runes. Only goblins have the ability to give them a good shake and extend them to their full shillelagh-like size and length. At full length, they are worthwhile one-handed clubs that jingle when they shake, and leave glittering dust when they impact.

* **Goblin Bag:** The Goblin Bag is a special item full of reagents and other weird components for use in special goblin "magic" spells. Goblins constantly connect weird things to add to their bags, otherwise considered worthless by all other intelligent creatures. Without a goblin bag, many goblin spells cannot be used.

**Small But Also Tall:** A Trio that takes up the same space can stand foot-to-shoulder as tall as a human. They can also separate to fit through smaller spaces individually.

**Strength in Numbers:** TBD

**Goblin Death:** When the Trio's HP total is reduced to Zero, one of the Goblins of the Trio has unfortunately been killed. Either choose the most logical Goblin based on the circumstances of the damage, or roll randomly. The remaining goblins flee immediately, scattering away until 1d10 rounds after the combat ends. Upon returning, the trio's stats are permanently reduced as such, and they suffer a disadvantage on all actions until they find a replacement.

**Replacing a Dead Goblin:** Replacing a lost goblin requires access to a goblin community,

**Goblin Magic, Basic:** Goblin Acrobat Trios are spellcasters, of sorts. Starting at level 1 and again with each new level, they gain one random ability from the below. If a known ability is rolled, roll again. These are cast as normal spells, using all standard spellcasting rules. If only two goblins are present, casting times are doubled; if only one goblin, magic is impossible.

1. **Goblin Analyze/Comprehend/Read:**
2. **Goblin Charm Person:** TBD
3. **Goblin Detect Magic:**
4. **Goblin Hold Portal:** Time: 1 Action; Range: 20ft; Duration: 3d6 rounds or until released (whichever is first). The goblins use pressure and balance techniques to jam a portal shut as per the spell. They are completely occupied while doing so.
5. **Goblin Light:** Time: 1 Action, Range: Self; Duration: 6 Turns. One of the goblins lights its goblin stick on fire and balances it on its head. The stick is not consumed, but the goblin is otherwise occupied until it puts away the light.
6. **Goblin Magic Missile:** Time: 1 Action, Range 60ft, Damage 3d4. The goblins hop down and pelt their target with, insults, and various disgusting things pulled from their goblin bag.
7. **Goblin Protection From Bad Guys:** Time: 1 Action; Target: 1 Ally within 10 ft; Duration: 6 rounds. The goblins whip out their goblin sticks and run circles around an ally or targeted spot. Any enemy that approaches within 10 feet of the target must make a Body save or be immobilized by a whack to the knee caps; if successful, they must then make a Mind save or be driven back by embarrassing vulgar taunts.
8. **Goblin Shield:** Time: 1 Action
9. **Goblin Sleep:** Time: 1 action, Range 20 ft. The goblins run through the target area, throwing sleeping powder in the targets' faces.
10. **Goblin Ventriloquism:**

**Goblin Magic, Advanced:** Starting at level 11, having mastered all ten of the basic magic forms, the trio begins to learn advanced magic which more often than not involves the loss of one or more goblins. Roll randomly for each level.

* **Goblin Acquire Object:** Time: 3d6 Days; Range: Self. If any member of the trio - past or present! - has physically touched a specific object in the past, the trio can use this power to acquire it. To cast the spell, all current members of the trio must shake hands, and then one goblin climbs into the bag. 3d6 days later, the object emerges from the bag. The questing goblin has a 5% chance of also surviving per day of the spell - if failed, the goblin is lost forever.
* **Goblin Bomb:** Time: 1 Action; Range: Movement. One or more of the goblins becomes unexpectedly explosive. All affected goblins charge toward their target. Upon arrival, they detonate violently, doing their level in dice of damage. The base damage die is d6 if a single goblin, d8 if two goblins, and d10 if all three goblins sacrifice themselves.
* **Goblin Continual Burning:** Time: 1 Action; Range: Self. One of the Goblins is now completely immune to fire and heat  damage, but also permanently on fire. Reduce the Trio's total HP by 1/4 (round up) permanently. One goblin is now constantly on fire. This provides light, but also burning, with all the pros and cons you might expect in such an arrangement.
* **Goblin Evolution:** Time: Immediate upon Leveling. One goblin eats another goblin, mutating into a Hob-goblin. Combine the two goblins' stats together, and increase the Hit Die of the new "duo" by one step (reroll hit points accordingly). The "trio" is now a hob-goblin and goblin duo.
  - **Evolution, 2nd Stage:** If evolution is rolled a second time, the hobgoblin devours the smaller goblin and morphs into a massive Ur-Bugbear. Completely consumed by primal rage, it must make a Mind Save (target: 15). If successful, the character is now transformed into equivalent of an equal-level Half-Ogre Berzerker. If failed, the character is now a dangerous villain that the rest of the party must now fight!
* **Goblin Resurrection:** The goblins collect the either currently-dying or recently-slain (1 hour) corpse of a named ally and shove them into their Goblin Bag. At the next stroke of midnight (local time), a new goblin with the deceased's memories climbs out, to either join an existing diminished trio, or start a new trio of their own. If the body was dying, the new XP level is one-half (rounded up) the previous, but if the body was a corpse the new level is 1.
* **Goblin Vanish:** Time: 1 minute; Range: Self. One Goblin climbs into the Goblin Bag for a minute. Upon emerging, it is permanently either invisible, inaudible, or both, at the player's discretion. If only one was chosen, then each subsequent morning there is a cumulative 5% chance of the goblin running insane into the wilderness, never to be seen again. If both were chosen, the chance is doubled.


#### Half-elf Bard (Hybrid, alternate Elf Exemplar)

* **Prime Stats:** ???
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** ???
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** ???
  - **Okay:** ???
  - **Bad:** ???
* **Gear Restrictions:** ???
* **Bonus Languages:** Elf


#### Halfling Tourist (Rogue, alternate Half-ogre Berserker)

* **Prime Stats:** CHA
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** D: You have no level-based combat bonus to attacks.
* **Base Movement:** 20
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death, Luck, Mind = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Area, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** None
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all small weapons one-handed, or medium two-handed. Cannot use two-handed human-sized weapons. Can use shields.
* **Bonus Languages:** Halfling

**Credit Card:** The Halfing Tourist can attempt a Luck Save to freely acquire any total purchase that costs their XP level or lower in Gold Pieces. This must be used on complete purchases, and not on individual items. If a natural 1 is rolled, make a second roll. If that roll is *also* failed, the tourist loses this ability until they level up, *and* a Debt Collector monster (Smith's Choice) is now seeking them out.

**Culinary Connoisseur:**

**Often Overlooked:** Unless their actions indicate them to be an obvious threat, or their opponents are otherwise specifically predisposed against them, a halfling is always attacked last.


#### Vulterran Scout (Warrior, alternate Half-ogre Berserker)

Lanky wolf-men of the Great Northern Reach, Vulterran Scouts are rarely seen in the lands of Humankind and its allies. The Northlands are largely seen as barbaric wilds by the "civilised" Kingdoms of Humans, but there are actually rich cultures with long-reaching histories, mostly unknown to all residents South of their harsh bounds. Vulterran Scouts range into the lands of Humans, seeking information, allies, and potential targets of eventual raid and conquest.

* **Prime Stats:** STR, DEX
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** ???
* **Base Movement:** 30 bipedal, 45 quadrupedal
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Luck, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Mind, Body, Death = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Area = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons except crossbows. All armor and clothing must be crafted to fit a large canine.
* **Bonus Languages:** Vulterran

**A Visceral Combination:**

**Blood for Blood:** Vulterran Scouts grow more fierce the closer they are to death. When their current HP is equal to or less than half their maximum, their melee damage is doubled. If their current HP is equal to or less than their current XP level, their damage is *tripled*.

**Never Unarmed aka Claw-Claw-Bite:** Vulterran Scouts can use any melee weapon, but don't need to in most circumstances. Their claws and teeth ensure they are never unarmed, and in fact they gain a bonus attack die at levels 1 and 9, which only applies when unarmed.
