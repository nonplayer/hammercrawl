# The Basics of Hammersmithin'


## Core Principles of the 'Smith

Some basic principles to follow:

* **Always tell the Players their Target Numbers!** Seriously, don't waste everyone's time with that pointlessly sneaky number-concealing bullshit. This game is meant to move fast, and hiding DCs and Targets just slows things down for the sole sake of forcing some stupid un-fun antiquated artificial anti-metagame crap on everyone. When they need to Save, tell them the target before they roll. When they commit to an attack, tell them the enemy's Defense so they can just tell you if they hit and not wait for you to verify it. Quit that middling crap and step up your game.
* **Roll in the Open, and Don't Fudge the Dice!** Fudging dice is lame as lame can be. If you're going to roll dice, then commit to it. If you're not going to commit to it, just put on the big kid britches, say what happens instead, and move on - no roll required. Throw the bones out in the open for all to see. You can't expect the players to play fair and true to the rules if you don't do the same.
* **Listen to the Players!** Players often come up with way cooler ideas than you ever thought of. Listen to them, mine their passing throw-away jokes for gold, and then use it against them later. The best spur-of-the-moment games are often driven by the players' own side comments. Save yourself the effort and let the players unknowingly do all your work for you!
* **Egg and Entice them!** Give them big red shiny buttons that say "do not push" and then watch them fight over who gets to push them. Place the most stupidly obvious traps in their way and watch them second-guess themselves. And cheer them on the whole time!


## Setting Up Your Side of the Table

(TBD)

Core things you'll need:

1. Knowledge of the Rules
2. A Dungeon
3. Dice
4. Helpful additional Randomizers


### 1. The Rules

Read these pages, and reap the rewards of knowledge.


### 2. The Dungeon

(TBD)

* Be sure to set the Difficulty
* Determine the total Hit Dice of the "floor boss" monster. This in turn sets the Tier of the dungeon, per the Tier rules in the Player Guide.


### 3. The Dice

(TBD)


### The Divining Dice

Okay, I'm assuming you know about gaming dice already and probably have dozens of them at least. So we're not gonna go into describing what they are and how to roll them. In short, you just need a standard set, consisting of a d4, d6, d8, d10, d%, d12, and d20. You may find it helpful to have multiple d20s, and a few extras of the d4, d6, and d8 as well.

Additionally, HAMMERCRAWL! makes use of the special colorful dice from the Genesys RPG to help the 'Smith randomly generate threat and other ideas on the spur of the moment (most commonly when they move into the next room of the dungeon). For the purposes of HAMMERCRAWL! the dice are as follows:

* **Red - The Difficulty Dice:** A fluctuating pool of dice that determine the ongoing base challenge against the PCs.
* **Green - The Reward Dice:** A pool of dice that increase as the PCs delve onward, giving them greater treasures and rewards.
* **Purple - The Risk Dice:** A growing pool of pain and suffering dice that accompany said increase in reward.
* **Blue - The Good Fortune Dice:** Dice that represent clever ideas and good luck in play.
* **Black - The Bad Fortune Dice:** Dice that represent chaos working against the PCs.
* **Yellow - The Expert Dice:** Dice that come into play when the PCs have the right tool, spell, or hireling for the job.

### 4. The Additional Randomizers

This game works best if you keep a handful of randomizers at hand at all times during play. There are a number of them linked in Appendix R of this document, but that list is by no means fully comprehensive. New tools of this sort seem to pop up every year, and as such it's a glorious time to be gaming and into RPG randomizers.



# Specific Hammersmith Actions

The sub-sections beyond are an alphabetized reference of all the specific Hammersmith rules for core actions you are expected to take. These are mainly the *new* game rules, unique to the HAMMERCRAWL! experience, and most have been previously referenced in the Players' section.


## The Explore Action

This is the real meat of the HAMMERCRAWL! experience, right here. The Explore Action is the primary method of moving the game onward. Most of the at-table randomization happens when the party chooses to explore and move onward.

Here's What you need to do when the players choose a new Explore Action:


### Build the Divining Pool

First build the Base Pool:

* **Difficulty Dice:** The Pool starts with one Red Die, but this number may be increased by "despair" rolls (see "Determine Outcome" below). This number resets only after the party has left the dungeon and a significant amount of world time has passed.
* **Escalating Risk and Reward Dice:** For each room they explore *beyond the first room*, add one Green Die and one Purple Die. This number resets when the camp or return to town.

Now, add any additional dice based on a variety of situational factors:

* **Are they exploring without an active Light Source?** Add a number of Black Dice equal to one-half (rounded up) the Party size.
* **Did they raise an alarm or otherwise fore-warn the room's occupants somehow?** Add a Black Die.
* **Are they taking any clever precautions or plans (other than the usual trap-checking)?** Add a Blue Die for each "really good idea" they have.
* **Do they have any useful tools that might affect the situation?** Add a Yellow Die if they are making active use of perfectly specialized gear or experts, such as maps, special hirelings, magical guides, and so on.
* **Did anyone actually say "Huzzah!" when entering?** Add both one Blue and one Black die to the Pool.
* **Other Mods:** Add more dice based on whim, nefarious plans, the "Scout Ahead" camp action results, cocky player complacency, shifting planes, stock market trends, and whatever else you feel makes sense.

Additionally, depending on how you are generating your dungeon, you may need to add one or more "mundane" dice to the pool to build the encounter. See "Random Encounters" later in this document.

***With the pool assembled, Roll the Dice!***


### Determine Outcome

Once rolled, the following symbols cancel each other out one for one:

* Arrows vs Targets
* Sun-Circles vs X-Circles

Suns and Xs *do not* cancel each other out, as they form the basis for all challenge and reward in this system of divination.


#### Arrows vs Targets: Boons

These dice symbols set up Boons for one side of the following encounter.

**Arrows:** (aka the "Boon" symbol - Green, Blue, and Yellow) - For each net Arrow rolled, add one to a temporary pool of expendable die-roll Boons that *the PCs* can use at their discretion in the next room. Boons must be described and feasible within the confines of the narrative. These Boons do not carry on to other rooms, and are lost as soon as the PCs move on.

**Targets:** (aka the "Threat" symbol - Red, Black, and Purple) - For each net Target rolled, add one to a temporary pool of expendable die-roll Banes that *the Hammersmith* can use at his discretion in the next room, applying them to the PCs stated actions. Banes must be described and feasible within the confines of the narrative. These Banes do not carry on to other rooms, and are lost as soon as the PCs move on.


#### Suns vs Xs: Encounter Modification

**Suns:** (aka the "Success" symbol - Green, Blue, and Yellow) - Each Sun represents a tangible benefit for the players in the next room. Example benefits:

* The room contains a(n additional) random friendly encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward friendly.
* Decrease the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The party catches the room's encounter(s) by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Party.
* The room will function as a Safe Haven once cleared of encounters.
* The party discovers a discarded cache of 1d6 basic supplies of the 'Smith's discretion (torches, water, rations, potions, etc).
* The room is guaranteed to have some random treasure, regardless of monsters or challenges present.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Magical.

Additionally, each Sun increases the PCs' potential XP rewards for surviving the encounter by 1, but *only* if there is at least one X in the pool as well.

**X:** (aka the "Failure" symbol - Red, Black, and Purple) - Each X represents a noteworthy threat against the PCs in the next room of the Dungeon. Example threats include:

* The room contains a(n additional) random hostile encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward hostile.
* Increase the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The occupants of the room catch the party by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Enemies.
* The room contains a dangerous trap that may or may not be concealed.
* The party's supplies suffer unexpected loss or spoilage of 1d6 items (fresh rations rot, lights burn out, phials and flasks shatter, etc).
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Cursed.

Additionally, each X increases the PCs' potential XP rewards for surviving the encounter by 1.


#### Sun-Circles vs X-Circles: Great Fortunes

**Sun with Circles:** (aka the "Triumph" symbol - Yellow only) - Counts as a regular Sun, plus it *decreases* by 1 the number of Difficulty Dice in all subsequent Divining Pools while in this Dungeon. This *can* reduce the number of Difficulty Dice to zero for a single room, potentially earning the party a temporary reprieve of danger in the next room. However, immediately after, subsequent Difficulty pools reset to one die, unless subsequent Circle-Stars similarly reduce them again.

**X with Circles:** (aka the "Threat" symbol - Red only) - Counts as a regular X, plus *increases* by 1 the number of Difficulty Dice in all subsequent Divining Pools while in this Dungeon. We recommend a limit of four Difficulty dice, but hey, it's your murder fantasy, so do what you will.


### Back to the Role-Playing

With the results of the Divining Dice resolved, it's time to get back to the role-playing. Introduce the room and its challenges as normal. Let the party explore, fight, etc. Describe what happens, and move on with play!


## The "Return to Town" Action

When the adventuring party chooses to return to town, follow the instructions in the Player Guide and role-play the town experience. You can do this as programatically as you like, but we prefer using Town Time to catch up on favored local NPCs, plant new rumors of area happenings, and generally get to know the characters and their world a little better.

When they eventually return to the dungeon, it's entirely possible that new monsters have moved into the dungeon rooms that the party previously cleared. This is entirely up to you and the nature of your dungeon, but we recommend adding in some new chance encounters there, or at least upping your random encounter rolls, to keep the party from getting too comfortable. I mean, this is HAMMERCRAWL! after all, we have a reputation to uphold.

But regardless of how you choose to repopulate previous rooms, remember that these rooms *do not* grant any additional free Exploration XP when the party returns to them. They may earn XP from encounters within, but Exploration XP only comes from newly-Explored rooms.


# RANDOMIZE ALL THE THINGS

HAMMERCRAWL! is designed to be played with as little prep as possible, relying instead on a lot of on-the-fly at-the-table randomization.

For a Master List of links to various third-party Randomizers, see Appendix R, at the end of this document.


## Random Dungeons

When building a new dungeon for an adventure, I tend to follow one of two methods: The Cards Method, and The Donjon Method. I've detailed both below.

Note that these dungeon creation method by default assume the classic "X number of levels, a boss on each level, and a final boss at the end" format. Your methods and needs may vary.


### The Cards Method

**Required Materials:**

* **REQ:** Appropriate randomizer dungeon tile cards or dice (see Appendix R for a few suggestions); A standard set of RPG gaming dice
* **OPT:** Plastic card sleeves; Dry Erase markers

This method can be used either in advance of the game, or even on the fly while you play. It helps to have an area to lay all of your cards out, with some space so that you can draw connections between them.

**Pros:**

* Specialty cards and dice are cool as heck, and fun to use
* Can easily be done in advance, or on the fly.
* Works alongside the Divining Pool mechanic, allowing immediate dungeon generation as a result of Exploration
* Somewhat easier to tweak on the fly

**Cons:**

* This method isn't meant to generate "mega" dungeons. If those are your thing, try the Donjon method instead
* Generating on the fly can take a bit of time until you master the process


#### Dungeon Setup

Determine the following components:

* **# of Dungeon Levels:** Roll 2d4 -1
* **# of Rooms per Level:** Roll 2d4 +1

When done, multiply them together to determine how many total rooms are in the entire dungeon. To make sure all involved are on the same page, we advise just letting the PCs know all three of these numbers before they go in.

You will also need to establish the Dungeon Level Tier of the first level of the Dungeon (see the "Tiers" section in the Player Guide). This is based on the Hit Dice of the "boss" of the first dungeon level. This is primarily used to assist you in generating suitable dangers and encounters for the first level of the dungeon.

It's usually a good idea to predetermine the end objective of this dungeon. You can use various randomizers to determine this, or instead have the players decide (it can often more fun that way). This final objective usually involves some nature of "Final Boss" at the bottom of the dungeon.


#### The First Room

* **Determine first room and exits**
* **Do NOT check for Stairs or Bosses**

Draw a card / roll a die. Take note of possible exits, make sure they comply with the room total for the level, and adjust accordingly if they don't.


#### Subsequent Rooms

* **Add rooms and exits**
* **Roll d12 for Stairs down**
* **Roll d20 for Level Boss**

Draw/roll the next room, and place it down next to the previous one on your working map. Once again make note of exits leading deeper into the dungeon.

Additionally, for each room *beyond* the very first room of each dungeon level, roll a D12 and a d20, the results of which determine the locations of **Stairs Down** and **Level Bosses**. We don't recommend placing either of these in the first room of a dungeon level, but really, it's your choice.

**Stairs Down:** You'll need to check to see if the room contains passage down to the next level - we call these "Stairs Down" in this text, but the transit can take any appropriate form you desire. Check the results of the d12 you rolled: if the number is *lower than* the number of rooms already explored on that level, then one of its exits leads down a level. If you make it to the last room of the level without rolling any Stairs Down, then that last room automatically has one. It's up to you (or your randomizers!) if a level can contain multiple Stairs Down, or if any of them are hidden behind secret doors.

**Level Boss:** Additionally, every dungeon level has a Boss, whose HD sets the "Tier" of the current dungeon level (see "Tiers" in the Player Guide). Check the results of the d20 you rolled: if the number is *lower than* the number of rooms already explored on that level, it contains a Boss-class enemy, whose strength is likely to be somewhat higher than that of the PCs. There should probably be only one boss per level, unless you're feeling particularly sadistic.

As for the nature of the boss itself, you already set the first level Boss's HD in the dungeon setup, so use your randomizers or encounter lists to choose an appropriate enemy with that strength.


#### Subsequent Levels

* **Add rooms and exits**
* **Roll d12 for Stairs down**
* **Roll d20 for Level Bosses**

Continue to build out the dungeon as above, with each level starting its own count for stairs and boss checks.


#### The Final Level

* **Add rooms and exits**
* **Roll d20 for Final Boss**

On the last level of the dungeon, you no longer need to roll for Stairs Down. Additionally, the roll for the Boss determines the location of the **Final Boss** of the dungeon. This is usually the main objective of the entire adventure, and defeating it will usually be enough to "complete" the dungeon.

It's up to you if the final Dungeon Boss is _also_ the boss of its own dungeon level. While it usually makes sense that way, it can be fun to also have a separate powerful level boss as the main henchman of the Dungeon Boss.


### The Donjon Method

**Required Materials:**

* A computer with an internet connection
* The Donjon website (see Appendix R)

**Pros:**

* Everything you probably need and more at the click of a button
* Dungeons can be saved offline for later reference
* A truly staggering amount of customization and detail

**Cons:**

* Requires internet connection to actively use at the table
* Small number of systems supported, with some feature imparity across those systems
* Lining up stairs down on multiple levels can be tricky
* Changing the format of a subsequent level requires a whole new seed
* Generated encounters can be excessively powerful

The Donjon website has an extremely detailed set of random dungeon generators. Using them to pre-build your dungeon can save a lot of time at the table for playing. The dungeon generator is *extremely* powerful and customizable, so much so that I can't possibly give it a a proper description in this text. In short, it allows you to create dungeons of all shapes, sizes, contents, and themes, in the click of a single button. And for some systems it can even generate encounters.

For games using the core HAMMERCRAWL! game mechanics, you may likely find the "AD&D" dungeon generator on the Donjon to be the most compatible. I have been working on porting BECMI- and B/X-compatible data to it as well, but it's a long time out.


### Converting Pre-Made Maps

People like Dyson Logos, Miska Friedman, and Karl Stjernberg (links?) pop out dungeon material at lightning speeds, making them prime sources of dungeon inspiration. If you don't want to make a dungeon on the fly, but don't have time to map out and populate your own from the ground up, here's how to convert an existing one for use as the map for an otherwise randomly-generated HAMMERCRAWL! game.

If the dungeon is already populated, then you're in luck! Use that as the basis for the adventure, and then let the Divining Dice change things on the fly by increasing or decreasing encounters. Pre-populated dungeons are pretty easy to work with, as they give you the basic expectation of what's in there from the beginning, so you already have a stock of options to take inspiration from. You can either use the rooms as-is, or alter them to your liking to fit the party and their level. If you change things up, be sure to set proper Level Boss locations for periodic increases in challenge.

If the dungeon is not already populated, you'll need to put together an encounter table for it first (see below). And you'll want to determine the Lair Nodes here, as well.


## Random Encounters

There are two generally-established types of encounters in most HAMMERCRAWL! games: room encounters and wandering monsters.


### Room Encounters

Room encounters consist of any encounters pre-stocked in new rooms that the adventurers explore. If you're running a pre-built dungeon then these will most likely be laid out for you already.

If you're generating your encounters completely on the fly, then you'll need to do a bit of improvisation here. While the actual nature of the creatures themselves are entirely up to you and whatever lists and/or randomizers you are using, this text recommends sticking with the core HAMMERCRAWL! Tier system as an initial method of eyeballing the power level of the encounters.

In mechanical terms, this means that since you should have already determined the "Tier" of the current dungeon level (by way of the initial dungeon setup), you should already have an eyeballed HD range for most of the common contents of the level. Once you know the intended HD range of the encounter, you can then use the results of the Divining Pool roll to potentially raise or lower it in accordance with the fluctuating threat levels of the adventure.


### Wandering Monsters

While you're ultimately free to check for Wandering Monsters anywhere you damn well please, the most common times to do so are when the party is traveling through previously-explored rooms, or instead between Town and the Dungeon. These checks are mainly meant to give the local ecology at least some minor semblance of active life, and not so much instead to be ritual punishment for the party (although that's perfectly fine as well).

The standard "check" for a Random Encounter is rolling a single d6, with an encounter occurring on a roll of 6. If you want to increase the chances, increase the die size to a d8 or more, with encounters occurring on a roll of 6 or higher. The frequency of these checks is up to you, or possibly specified by your dungeon (if you're using a pre-built one). We recommend a basic approach of checking twice-daily, in the morning and in the evening. You may also want to check each time the party returns to a previously-explored room of the dungeon.

This document does not intend on providing lengthy random encounter tables. As of this time, the contents of your dungeon's encounter tables are up to you.


### Encounter Reaction Checks

When generating a random encounter, you may wish to also randomly determine the "reaction" of the encountered group to the arrival of the adventuring party (if you haven't decided already). Roll 2d6, and consult the following table.

**Modifiers:** If the adventurers are attempting to be diplomatic, their spokesperson's CHA mod (positive or negative) may apply to this roll.

| 2d6   | Reaction        |
|-------|-----------------|
| 2-3   | Open Hostility! |
| 4-6   | Aggression      |
| 7-9   | Wariness        |
| 10-11 | Ambivalence     |
| 12    | Friendliness    |

The result determines the reaction type displayed by the encountered group. The divining pool results may further modify these at your discretion. Most of these results allow the possibility of **Parley**, detailed further below.

**Open Hostility:** The group is immediately hostile! If they consider the party to be a beatable challenge, they immediately attack (move to Combat rules). If they feel significantly weaker than the party, they may flee or even surrender. It's your call, but either way they will not engage in Parley.

**Aggression:** The group will not immediately attack, but chances are likely that they will move to Open Hostility unless the PCs change the situation somehow. Aggressive groups may be willing to Parley with the PCs, but this will be difficult. If the 'Smith requires a check, add a Bane.

**Wariness:** The group will not immediately attack, but will still respond to the PCs with suspicion and possible challenges. Wary groups may be willing to Parley with the PCs, and the 'Smith may require a check for this to succeed.

**Ambivalence:** The group is more or less neutral to the PCs, responding to them without any hostility, but likewise without any overt amity either. Ambivalent groups may be willing to Parley with the PCs; if the 'Smith requires a check, add a Boon.

**Friendliness:** The group is immediately welcoming to the PCs, displaying no signs of hostility. Friendly groups will always be willing to Parley without requiring a check.


### Parley

Although the HAMMERCRAWL! system tends to assume that combat is an inevitable conclusion when two parties meet in a dungeon, it doesn't always have to go that way. In fact, if the players wish to survive to their next levels, they should probably make a habit of engaging in friendly discussion with new groups whenever feasible. If they encounter a new group and wish to keep things social, then you can call for the **Parley** rules described here.

If the encountered group's Reaction was less than Friendly, you may require that the chosen spokesperson for the party must first succeed at a "Parley Check" in order to continue the encounter without moving to combat. To do this, they must role-play their greeting, and then roll a Rally Save, with the target based on the tier difference between the two groups. Some of the Reactions may apply Boons or Banes to this. Additionally, if the encountered group is of a nature to care about the party's societal status, you may apply one of more of the PCs' Social stat mods to this result as well, at your discretion.

If the Parley check succeeds, then the groups have agreed to converse. Keep the game play focused in general role-playing and Beat-based time-keeping, and do not initiate combat unless (or until?) the situation takes an unexpected turn towards violence.

If the check fails, the encountered group either outright attacks, departs, or otherwise demands that the PCs themselves leave, at your decision. If required, begin Combat rounds and time-tracking.

## Random Traps

I use the following roll table for traps. The basic names are cribbed directly from a few hundred test rolls on the Donjon, and then I added my own level-specific rules to use for them instead. I also got rid of Save-or-Die traps because reasons. Most results are based on the dungeon level:

| Roll | Trap                                                                                  |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Acid Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                          |
| 2  | Arrow Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                         |
| 3  | Blinding Gas Trap                                                                       |
| 4  | Elevator Room Trap (descends 1 level)                                                   |

| 7  | Fire Trap (1d6 damage)                                                                  |
| 8  | Flooding Pit Trap (1d6 x 10 x level feet, 1d6 damage per 10 ft.)                        |
| 9  | Flooding Room Trap                                                                      |
| 10 | Lightning Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                     |
| 11 | Net Trap                                                                                |
| 12 | Pendulum Trap (1d6 x 1d6 x level damage)                                                |
| 13 | Pit Trap (1d6 x 10 x level feet, 1d6 damage per 10 ft.)                                 |

| 17 | Sleep Gas Trap                                                                          |
| 18 | Spear Trap (1d8 x level damage)                                                         |
| 19 | Spiked Pit Trap (1d6 x 10 x level feet, 1d8 damage per 10 ft.)                          |
| 20 | Teleporter Trap                                                                         |


### On the Subject of Traps...

TBD

(undeveloped notes on their use in play)

Dangerous traps with saving throws are fine, but you should always make sure that there are ways that the players can discover to bypass them (and thus not have to roll a save). A skilled 'Smith learns to subtly telegraph their existence with simple clues given to players who wisely choose to investigate their surroundings. This shouldn't even require a Thief in the party, although the presence of one can greatly assist.

Similarly, *any* player character can attempt to disable a trap they discover, with no need for a roll. If they figure out the trap's mechanism through exploration and role-playing, and then discover the method to disable it, then they should be allowed to simply do so - provided the physical act is within their realm of possibility. For example, if they find the hidden lever that disables a trap, they can then use that lever without having to roll for it. If that lever is out of reach on the other side of a gate, however, they will need to develop other solutions.

Thus I recommend that you encourage the players to not rely on their Thief, and in fact to consider the Thief something of a last resort, a kind of super-powered dungeon specialist that is called upon to save the day when all other options have failed.

Instead of rolling and tracking multiple running hit point totals for all of your combatants, this game system suggests using a more simplified method of health tracking. Heavy HP bookkeeping is exchanged for light token-flipping and damage save rolls.

When a PC successfully attacks a NPC, they must roll their damage as usual. The NPC must then make a special Death saving throw, with the PC's total damage roll as the difficulty target for this save. If the NPC is listed with any numerical modifier on their Hit Dice (such as "3HD+3"), then they apply that modifier to their Death save.

If the NPC fails this save, they are inflicted with a Wound, or two if they rolled a natural 1. Each wound taken stacks, and once a NPC takes a number of wounds equal to or greater than their Hit Die total, that NPC is slain.

If the NPC succeeds at this save, they instead take a Scratch. Scratches also accumulate, and for each Scratch the NPC suffers a Bane on subsequent Death saves to resist wounds. Once a NPC fails a Death save and takes a wound, erase all of its current Scratches.

Keeping track of scratches and remaining HD can be done with simple use of a small die (such as a d6) counting scratches, and a larger die (such as d12 or higher) counting down the NPC's remaining HD. It can be handy to keep a d30 on hand for the more powerful boss monsters, when needed. Alternately, a bowl of different-colored tokens can be used, with one color representing Scratches, and the other representing Wounds.

If the total incoming damage from an attack is greater than the NPC could possibly roll on its Death save, it can only succeed at the roll by rolling a natural unmodified 20.

For NPCs with Zero (or fewer!) Hit Dice - including weak NPCs given only a small handful of HPs in lieu of HD - they need not make Death saving throws when hit. Instead, any hit for any amount of damage will dispatch them immediately, no Wounds required.

# Appendix D: Dungeon Generation Archive

I've revamped the dungeon generation process from an older set of rules. Instead of ditching those rules entirely, I've preserved them here in an Appendix. You may still find them useful to your method.


### Building Dungeons in Advance

If you have a set of Dungeonmorph cards, you can instead use my personal method for pre-game dungeon generation. This saves time in play if you have it in advance, and creates some pretty interesting setups.

Tools required are:

* A shuffled stack of Dungeonmorph tiles. I have 90 of them, in dry-erase sleeves, with the tops trimmed off to make placement easier.
* Dice: you need a d3, d4, d6, and d8. Last two really only for occasional exit checks. These could also be simplified to a d6 and d8 as well.
* Dry erase markers: Black, Green, and Red

With those prepared, then determine the number of "nodes" (tiles) for the current dungeon level: Level + 5 + 3d4.

For the entrance, pull the top card and set it out. Roll 1d8 to determine which of the eight exists is the entrance to the dungeon. Mark the entrance with a Green Dot.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which of the remaining sides of the currently-placed tile to add the next tile to.

Draw the next dungeon tile and add it to the side determined. Roll 1d4 to determine which side of the new tile connects. Rotate accordingly and lay it down so the new side connects to the the prior card.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which exits on that side connect through to the previous card: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both. Use a black marker to mark out blocked ways, if applicable.

Repeat process, building out the dungeon to the pre-rolled number of rooms. Sometimes sides will be pre-filled as the dungeon rolls back into itself. In those cases, adjust the base 1d3 to different die sizes to fit accordingly.

Whenever a new tile connects to a previously-laid one _other than_ the most recent, roll 1d4 to determine if any of that previous tile's exits on that side connect to the new tile: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both, 4 = none! use a black marker to mark through blocked passages, if any.

If a tile is placed in a fashion that leaves it with no available spaces to add the next tile, place the next tile in the next best available side of the previous tile, and so on.

The last tile placed has the exit to the next level. Randomly roll which exit gets this distinction, and then mark the exit with a Red Dot

When finished, use a black marker to fill in the "dead exits" on the tiles as makes the most sense for the dungeon you have built.

Once you have the flow mastered, this process takes no more than 5-10 minutes per dungeon level. Since even a single level can play host to a multitude of game sessions, you most likely only really need one or two, tops. With 90 available tiles, the scenery remains fresh for many sessions of adventuring.


#### (Optional) Setting Lair Nodes

A "Lair Node" is a tile where a guaranteed Lair Fight will occur. These will have larger encounter numbers, and most likely pose great challenges to the players. Choosing their locations in advance can give you a bit more freedom and strategy mid-session when guiding the game proper.

Each level of the Dungeon should have a number of Lair Nodes equal to the level of the dungeon + 1d4. The easiest way to place them is to just look at the dungeon you have created, and place them in the mist interesting-looking, lair-like tiles. Otherwise, divide the number of tiles by the number of lairs, and then roughly space them out every X tiles. Placing a lair on the exit tile is usually a fun setup!

Do not pre-populate the denizens of these Lair Nodes! Instead, let the random encounter generate them for you when discovered by the players.


### Building Dungeons on the Fly

If you're feeling creative and you have the tools on hand, you can build out the dungeon live at the table, as the party chooses the Explore action. For years I would use a combination of matching cards and dice from Dungeonmorph, but recently I've streamlined my method to use only the cards. You can use whatever method you prefer, but I've made notes on two options below.


#### The Dungeonmorph Dice Method

If you truly want a simple one shot, run-and-go, never-to-return method, use this one. There are 15 Dungeonmorph dice available for this task, each one a different theme of location.

To use this method, put them all into a bag, and pull one out at random. This one is the starting Node of the dungeon. Randomly determine which of the eight entrances is the actual dungeon entrance, and note it down.

Then, roll ALL the remaining dice at once, *except for one* - that's right, leave one in the bag. Take all the rolled dice and just assemble them willy-nilly like a wild-person, pushing them up against each other until you have one crazy-looking dungeon. Make sure the entrance die is on the outside.

Finally, roll that last die, add it somewhere interesting, and note it as the Exit to the next level. You now have yourself a completely randomized dungeon made of awesome dice, complete with entrance and the exit down to the next level. Go forth and plunder!


#### The Dungeonmorph Cards Method

Using just the tiles, you want to build a shuffled stack first of as many as you have, preferably in dry-erase sleeves. Draw one, and that's the first node of the dungeon. Roll 1d8 to determine the entrance, and close off the second entrance on that side. Then roll 1d6 to determine how many of the entrances on the other three sides also lead off somewhere. Use a marker to "seal" the rest off.

When the party Explores to a new area, draw another tile. Roll 1d4 to determine which of the new tile's sides connect, then place it down. Roll 1d6 again to determine how many of the other three sides' exits lead off to new places, and again use a marker to seal the rest off.

For each room visited after the starting room, there is a *cumulative* 1 in 20 chance that one of the exits of the room leads down to the next dungeon level. For the sake of at least *some* kind of consistency in all this insanity, I recommend only having one such lead-down per level. However, if you prefer truly organic creation and are down with more, just reset this count each time one is discovered.

If you somehow happen to "close off" the dungeon using the above methods, without rolling a level exit, either A) add a level exit organically to the last-placed node tile, or B) just accept it as a single-level dungeon and call it good. Not every dungeon needs to be a multi-level descent into the depths of Demon Heck!

# Appendix W: Using WFRP3 Dice

HAMMERCRAWL! got its name from my love of the old WFRP 3rd Edition custom dice, which I wanted to keep using for other gaming purposes after that edition of the game went out of print. As the years have passed, the dice have become harder to find, and more expensive to buy. As such, I've since revised (and happily simplified!) the process to work with the similar dice from FFG's ongoing Genesys RPG, which forms the basis for a growing catalog of games using the same basic dice. The Genesys dice are more universal, easier to read, and most importantly: still in manufacture (and as such cheaper to acquire). And I think the revisions to the HAMMERCRAWL! process actually work out a whole lot smoother, too.

However, I've kept the old WFRP-specific rules here in the appendix, both for each of possible future reference, and for nostalgia. The game *is* called "HAMMER"-crawl, after all!

## The Dice

With WFRP3 you get a mix of seven different types of dice, coded by color: Blue, Yellow, White, Green, Red, Black, and Purple. Each of these colors represents a different purpose, such as Challenge, Luck, Fortune, Skull, and so on. Their different faces have symbols instead of numerical pips, which you can use to divine the outcomes of tests in that game. For this game, the dice translate as:

* **Blue: The Reward Die** - rolled to find new fortunes and treasure.
* **Red: The "Huzzah!" Die** - rolled when the heroes are especially brave and/or foolhardy.
* **Green: The Caution Die** - rolled to reward careful strategy and conversation.
* **White: The Luck Die** - added to the pool for good ideas and plans.
* **Black: The Dark Die** - added when the players' own actions turn against them.
* **Yellow: The Die of Expertise** - representing solid applied skill and craft.
* **Purple: The Die of Challenge** - Purple dice can bring great danger and peril, but amplify XP!

Don't have dice of your own? [Use the Broken Tome generator](http://brokentome.com/tools/DiceRoller.aspx)! There are a number of other apps available as well:

* Android: [WFRP Dice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.WFRPDice&hl=en_US)
* PC: [WFRP 3rd Edition Dice Pool Tool Kit](https://rpggeek.com/filepage/60367/wfrp-3rd-edition-dice-pool-tool-kit)


## Building the Pool

The dice pool is built using a mix of regular gaming dice plus the fancy colored dice from WFRP3. **First we build the initial Divining Pool.** This consists of two or more Warhammer funky dice, and possibly additional standard dice based on your game system of choice and any other third-party random tables you're incorporating.

Start with:

* **Standard Blue Die:** Always Start with one Blue WFRP3 Die.
* **Challenge Level:** This is up to the players, chosen at the beginning of the dungeon! Add 1, 2, or 3 Purple WFRP3 dice.

Add any of the following based on in-game actions and context:

* **Did they stealthily enter the room?** Add a Green Die.
* **Did they kick in the door and rush the room?** Add a Red Die.
* **Did anyone actually say "Huzzah!" when entering?** Add another Red Die.
* **Are they exploring without an active Light Source?** Add a number of Black Dice equal to one-half (rounded up) the Party size.
* **Did they raise an alarm or otherwise fore-warn the room's occupants somehow?** Add a Black Die.
* **Are they taking any clever precautions or plans (other than the usual trap-checking)?** Add a White Die for each "really good idea" they have.
* **Do they have any useful tools that might affect the situation?** Add a Yellow Die if they are making active use of special gear, such as maps, potions, etc.
* **Other Mods:** Add more dice based on whim, nefarious plans, the "Scout Ahead" camp action results, cocky player complacency, shifting planes, stock market trends, and whatever else you feel makes sense.

Finally, depending on your game system, you may add other dice as well, such as:

* **d20:** To determine the Encounter Type in Dark Dungeons (pages 219-139)
* **Any other Dice:** If you have any other random check tables, add their dice to the pool, and roll them all at once to save time.


## Divining the Results

With the Divining Pool complete, it's time to roll! **I highly suggest using a dice tray for this.**

The special symbols on the WFRP3 divining dice translate to different aspects of both the transition and the next room beyond. These pips create a pool that can be used to more or less purchase different effects to apply to the journey forward. As DM, you pick and choose which outcomes to apply, based on the feel and beat of the current flow of the game. The results are determined as follows:

#### **Comets and Chaos Stars: Extreme Outcomes!**

**Note:** Comets and Chaos Stars *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

These represent extreme boons or dangers in the destination room/node of the dungeon. For each **Comet** rolled in the pool, add +3 Hammers to the results! For each Chaos Star, add +3 Crossblades!

Take note of and possibly apply effects from applicable Comets and Chaos Stars before moving on to...


#### **Blood Drops and Hour Glasses: Loss of Resources**

**Note:** Blood Drops and Hour Glasses *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Blood Drops:** INJURY! When blood drops are rolled (Red dice only), the team suffered damage or stress of some kind in their charge forward. Roll Xd4 damage (X = current dungeon level) and have the team apply it among themselves.

**Hourglasses:** DELAY! When an Hourglass is rolled (Green dice only), the team suffered some form of additional delay getting to the next room. Knock off an additional 1d4 Beats of game time.

Apply all effects from Blood Drops and Hourglasses before moving on to...


#### **Falcons and Skulls: Encounters in Transit**

**Note:** These cancel each other out one for one, and only the *net* total remaining are counted.

Falcons give the party temporary boons, while Skulls give them setbacks. Setbacks tend to be a bit worse than boons, though, but that's just how adventuring works.

Net *Falcons* represent minor boons encountered during travel to the next room. For each net Falcon, apply a boon similar to the items on the list below. These are somewhat free-form, use whatever makes sense:

* The explore action did not cost them any time or light.
* They find the hidden pack of a long lost adventurer and re-up some supplies.
* The party receives a bonus re-roll that can be used to re-roll any single die in the next room only.

Net *Skulls* represent minor setbacks incurred during travel to the next room. Similar to Falcons, apply from the list below:

* Their active light sources flicker and sputter for whatever reason, removing an extra 1d4 Beats of time from their durations.
* One of their maintained spells suddenly fails.
* Another random encounter happened by while in transit! (Roll a single Purple Die for this new challenge, ignoring any skulls)
* One of their rations spoils and must be discarded!

Apply all effects from net Falcons or Skulls before moving on to...


#### **Hammers and Crossblades: Encounters at the Destination**

Hammers and Crossblades determine the nature of the challenges in the next room, and any additional rewards they may give. Hammers and Crossblades also set the base XP rewards the party will earn for overcoming those challenges.

**Note:** Hammers and Crossblades *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Hammers:** Hammers represent greater boons and windfalls discovered in the *next room* of the dungeon. For each *total* Hammer in the pool, the next room/node contains a boon such as those on the list below. Each can be selected multiple times, even combined:

* The room contains a(n additional) random friendly encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward friendly.
* Decrease the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The party catches the room's encounter(s) by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Party.
* The room will function as a Safe Haven once cleared of encounters.
* The room is guaranteed to have some random treasure, regardless of monsters or challenges present.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Magical.
* ...or any from the Falcons list above.

**Crossblades:** Crossblades represent sources of danger encountered in the *next room* of the dungeon. Similar to Hammers, options for Crossblades include:

* The room contains a(n additional) random hostile encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward hostile.
* Increase the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The occupants of the room catch the party by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Enemies.
* The room contains a dangerous trap that may or may not be concealed.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Cursed.
* ...or any from the Skulls list above.

**Hammer-Plus:** (Yellow die only) Some yellow results show a hammer with a plus. That means to first count the Hammer toward the total, and then add *another* yellow die and immediately roll it, adding its results to the pool as well.

**Hammers, Crossblades, and XP:** Hammers and Crossblades together determine the base XP rewards the party receives after defeating the challenges in a room. Note that Hammers *only* reward XP if at least one Crossblade is also rolled. In other words, Hammers without Crossblades still provide any number of the boons listed above, but *do not* reward XP unless a Crossblade was also rolled, providing the base challenge of the new room.
