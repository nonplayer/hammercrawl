# The Basics of Hammersmithin'

Some basic principles to follow:

* **Always tell the Players their Target Numbers!** Seriously, don't waste everyone's time with that pointlessly sneaky number-concealing bullshit. This game is meant to move fast, and hiding DCs and Targets just slows things down for the sole sake of forcing some stupid un-fun antiquated artificial anti-metagame crap on everyone. When they need to Save, tell them the target before they roll. When they commit to an attack, tell them the enemy's AC so they can just tell you if they hit and not wait for you to verify it. Quit that middling crap and step up your game.
* **Roll in the Open, and Don't Fudge the Dice!** Fudging dice is lame as lame can be. If you're going to roll dice, then commit to it. If you're not going to commit to it, just put on the big kid britches, say what happens instead, and move on - no roll required. Throw the bones out in the open for all to see. You can't expect the players to play fair and true to the rules if you don't do the same.
* **Listen to the Players!** Players often come up with way cooler ideas than you ever thought of. Listen to them, mine their passing throw-away jokes for gold, and then use it against them later. The best spur-of-the-moment games are often driven by the players' own side comments. Save yourself the effort and let the players unknowingly do all your work for you!
* **Egg and Entice them!** Give them big red shiny buttons that say "do not push" and then watch them fight over who gets to push them. Place the most stupidly obvious traps in their way and watch them second-guess themselves. And cheer them on the whole time!


# Specific Hammersmith Actions

The sub-sections beyond are an alphabetized reference of all the specific Hammersmith rules for core actions you are expected to take. These are mainly the *new* game rules, unique to the HAMMERCRAWL! experience, and most have been previously referenced in the Players' section.


## The Explore Action

This is the real meat of the HAMMERCRAWL! experience, right here. The Explore Action is the primary method of moving the game onward. Most of the at-table randomization happens when the party chooses to explore and move onward.

Here's What you need to do when the players choose a new Explore Action:


### Build the Divining Pool

Next, it's time to roll the Divining Pool! This dice pool is built using a mix of regular gaming dice plus the fancy colored dice from WFRP3. **First we build the initial Divining Pool.** This consists of two or more Warhammer funky dice, and possibly additional standard dice based on your game system of choice and any other third-party random tables you're incorporating.

Start with:

* **Standard Blue Die:** Always Start with one Blue WFRP3 Die.
* **Challenge Level:** This is up to the players, chosen at the beginning of the dungeon! Add 1, 2, or 3 Purple WFRP3 dice.

Add any of the following based on in-game actions and context:

* **Did they stealthily enter the room?** Add a Green Die.
* **Did they kick in the door and rush the room?** Add a Red Die.
* **Did anyone actually say "Huzzah!" when entering?** Add another Red Die.
* **Are they exploring without an active Light Source?** Add a number of Black Dice equal to one-half (rounded up) the Party size.
* **Did they raise an alarm or otherwise fore-warn the room's occupants somehow?** Add a Black Die.
* **Are they taking any clever precautions or plans (other than the usual trap-checking)?** Add a White Die for each "really good idea" they have.
* **Do they have any useful tools that might affect the situation?** Add a Yellow Die if they are making active use of special gear, such as maps, potions, etc.
* **Other Mods:** Add more dice based on whim, nefarious plans, the "Scout Ahead" camp action results, cocky player complacency, shifting planes, stock market trends, and whatever else you feel makes sense.

Finally, depending on your game system, you may add other dice as well, such as:

* **d20:** To determine the Encounter Type in Dark Dungeons (pages 219-139)
* **Any other Dice:** If you have any other random check tables, add their dice to the pool, and roll them all at once to save time.


### Roll the Dice

With the Divining Pool complete, it's time to roll! **I highly suggest using a dice tray for this.**

The special symbols on the WFRP3 divining dice translate to different aspects of both the transition and the next room beyond. These pips create a pool that can be used to more or less purchase different effects to apply to the journey forward. As DM, you pick and choose which outcomes to apply, based on the feel and beat of the current flow of the game. The results are determined as follows:


#### **Comets and Chaos Stars: Extreme Outcomes!**

**Note:** Comets and Chaos Stars *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

These represent extreme boons or dangers in the destination room/node of the dungeon. For each **Comet** rolled in the pool, add +3 Hammers to the results! For each Chaos Star, add +3 Crossblades!

Take note of and possibly apply effects from applicable Comets and Chaos Stars before moving on to...


#### **Blood Drops and Hour Glasses: Loss of Resources**

**Note:** Blood Drops and Hour Glasses *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Blood Drops:** INJURY! When blood drops are rolled (Red dice only), the team suffered damage or stress of some kind in their charge forward. Roll Xd4 damage (X = current dungeon level) and have the team apply it among themselves.

**Hourglasses:** DELAY! When an Hourglass is rolled (Green dice only), the team suffered some form of additional delay getting to the next room. Knock off an additional 1d4 Turns of game time.

Apply all effects from Blood Drops and Hourglasses before moving on to...


#### **Falcons and Skulls: Encounters in Transit**

**Note:** These cancel each other out one for one, and only the *net* total remaining are counted.

Falcons give the party temporary boons, while Skulls give them setbacks. Setbacks tend to be a bit worse than boons, though, but that's just how adventuring works.

Net *Falcons* represent minor boons encountered during travel to the next room. For each net Falcon, apply a boon similar to the items on the list below. These are somewhat free-form, use whatever makes sense:

* The explore action did not cost them any time or light.
* They find the hidden pack of a long lost adventurer and re-up some supplies.
* The party receives a bonus re-roll that can be used to re-roll any single die in the next room only.

Net *Skulls* represent minor setbacks incurred during travel to the next room. Similar to Falcons, apply from the list below:

* Their active light sources flicker and sputter for whatever reason, removing an extra 1d4 turns of time from their durations.
* One of their maintained spells suddenly fails.
* Another random encounter happened by while in transit! (Roll a single Purple Die for this new challenge, ignoring any skulls)
* One of their rations spoils and must be discarded!

Apply all effects from net Falcons or Skulls before moving on to...


#### **Hammers and Crossblades: Encounters at the Destination**

Hammers and Crossblades determine the nature of the challenges in the next room, and any additional rewards they may give. Hammers and Crossblades also set the base XP rewards the party will earn for overcoming those challenges.

**Note:** Hammers and Crossblades *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Hammers:** Hammers represent greater boons and windfalls discovered in the *next room* of the dungeon. For each *total* Hammer in the pool, the next room/node contains a boon such as those on the list below. Each can be selected multiple times, even combined:

* The room contains a(n additional) random friendly encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward friendly.
* Decrease the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The party catches the room's encounter(s) by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Party.
* The room will function as a Safe Haven once cleared of encounters.
* The room is guaranteed to have some random treasure, regardless of monsters or challenges present.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Magical.
* ...or any from the Falcons list above.

**Crossblades:** Crossblades represent sources of danger encountered in the *next room* of the dungeon. Similar to Hammers, options for Crossblades include:

* The room contains a(n additional) random hostile encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward hostile.
* Increase the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The occupants of the room catch the party by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Enemies.
* The room contains a dangerous trap that may or may not be concealed.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Cursed.
* ...or any from the Skulls list above.

**Hammer-Plus:** (Yellow die only) Some yellow results show a hammer with a plus. That means to first count the Hammer toward the total, and then add *another* yellow die and immediately roll it, adding its results to the pool as well.

**Hammers, Crossblades, and XP:** Hammers and Crossblades together determine the base XP rewards the party receives after defeating the challenges in a room. Note that Hammers *only* reward XP if at least one Crossblade is also rolled. In other words, Hammers without Crossblades still provide any number of the boons listed above, but *do not* reward XP unless a Crossblade was also rolled, providing the base challenge of the new room.


### Back to the Role-Playing

With the results of the Divining Dice resolved, it's time to get back to the role-playing. Introduce the room and its challenges as normal. Let the party explore, fight, etc. Describe what happens, and move on with play!


# RANDOMIZE ALL THE THINGS

HAMMERCRAWL! is designed to be played with as little prep as possible, relying instead on a lot of on-the-fly at-the-table randomization.

For a Master List of links to various third-party Randomizers, see Appendix R, at the end of this document.


## Random Dungeons

To generate Dungeon rooms, I initially used a set of Dungeonmorph dice and their matching blue-and-white cards (the latter kept into handy dry-erase sleeves). They even come with little symbols and a handy key to them, for adding more spontaneous dungeon features on the fly.

Since starting this project, I've streamlined my process to use only the cards, saving the dungeon dice for more extreme one-off cases. The basic process involves going from room to room, encountering obstacles, grabbing treasure, and moving ever onward. When it's time to move to a new room, I grab one of the the dungeon cards and lay it out as the next room. The pieces are all laid out on the table, and the dungeon grows dynamically as the players explore it.

Conversely, the Donjon website (See Appendix R) has an extremely detailed set of random dungeon generators. Using them to pre-build your dungeon can save a lot of time at the table for playing. You can do the same with the dice and cards, too.

There are two basic approaches to Dungeon Generation. You can certainly do so on the fly. That can add some slow-down to a live play session, however, so I've provided tips on building it in advance, as well. While this does partially-defeat the whole "100% random" approach to play that is encouraged by this gaming method, I admit that the dungeon can be the trickiest thing to build on the fly, and the most time-consuming. To save on time, pre-designing a dungeon is pretty simple using the random dungeon generators at the Donjon. Hell, it can even pre-plan encounters, saving you the need to roll for the enemy types in your divining pool!


### Building Dungeons in Advance

If you have a set of Dungeonmorph cards, you can instead use my personal method for pre-game dungeon generation. This saves time in play if you have it in advance, and creates some pretty interesting setups.

Tools required are:

* A shuffled stack of Dungeonmorph tiles. I have 90 of them, in dry-erase sleeves, with the tops trimmed off to make placement easier.
* Dice: you need a d3, d4, d6, and d8. Last two really only for occasional exit checks. These could also be simplified to a d6 and d8 as well.
* Dry erase markers: Black, Green, and Red

With those prepared, then determine the number of "nodes" (tiles) for the current dungeon level: Level + 5 + 3d4.

For the entrance, pull the top card and set it out. Roll 1d8 to determine which of the eight exists is the entrance to the dungeon. Mark the entrance with a Green Dot.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which of the remaining sides of the currently-placed tile to add the next tile to.

Draw the next dungeon tile and add it to the side determined. Roll 1d4 to determine which side of the new tile connects. Rotate accordingly and lay it down so the new side connects to the the prior card.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which exits on that side connect through to the previous card: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both. Use a black marker to mark out blocked ways, if applicable.

Repeat process, building out the dungeon to the pre-rolled number of rooms. Sometimes sides will be pre-filled as the dungeon rolls back into itself. In those cases, adjust the base 1d3 to different die sizes to fit accordingly.

Whenever a new tile connects to a previously-laid one _other than_ the most recent, roll 1d4 to determine if any of that previous tile's exits on that side connect to the new tile: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both, 4 = none! use a black marker to mark through blocked passages, if any.

If a tile is placed in a fashion that leaves it with no available spaces to add the next tile, place the next tile in the next best available side of the previous tile, and so on.

The last tile placed has the exit to the next level. Randomly roll which exit gets this distinction, and then mark the exit with a Red Dot

When finished, use a black marker to fill in the "dead exits" on the tiles as makes the most sense for the dungeon you have built.

Once you have the flow mastered, this process takes no more than 5-10 minutes per dungeon level. Since even a single level can play host to a multitude of game sessions, you most likely only really need one or two, tops. With 90 available tiles, the scenery remains fresh for many sessions of adventuring.


#### (Optional) Setting Lair Nodes

A "Lair Node" is a tile where a guaranteed Lair Fight will occur. These will have larger encounter numbers, and most likely pose great challenges to the players. Choosing their locations in advance can give you a bit more freedom and strategy mid-session when guiding the game proper.

Each level of the Dungeon should have a number of Lair Nodes equal to the level of the dungeon + 1d4. The easiest way to place them is to just look at the dungeon you have created, and place them in the mist interesting-looking, lair-like tiles. Otherwise, divide the number of tiles by the number of lairs, and then roughly space them out every X tiles. Placing a lair on the exit tile is usually a fun setup!

Do not pre-populate the denizens of these Lair Nodes! Instead, let the random encounter generate them for you when discovered by the players.


### Building Dungeons on the Fly

If you're feeling creative and you have the tools on hand, you can build out the dungeon live at the table, as the party chooses the Explore action. For years I would use a combination of matching cards and dice from Dungeonmorph, but recently I've streamlined my method to use only the cards. You can use whatever method you prefer, but I've made notes on two options below.


#### The Dungeonmorph Dice Method

If you truly want a simple one shot, run-and-go, never-to-return method, use this one. There are 15 Dungeonmorph dice available for this task, each one a different theme of location.

To use this method, put them all into a bag, and pull one out at random. This one is the starting Node of the dungeon. Randomly determine which of the eight entrances is the actual dungeon entrance, and note it down.

Then, roll ALL the remaining dice at once, *except for one* - that's right, leave one in the bag. Take all the rolled dice and just assemble them willy-nilly like a wild-person, pushing them up against each other until you have one crazy-looking dungeon. Make sure the entrance die is on the outside.

Finally, roll that last die, add it somewhere interesting, and note it as the Exit to the next level. You now have yourself a completely randomized dungeon made of awesome dice, complete with entrance and the exit down to the next level. Go forth and plunder!


#### The Dungeonmorph Cards Method

Using just the tiles, you want to build a shuffled stack first of as many as you have, preferably in dry-erase sleeves. Draw one, and that's the first node of the dungeon. Roll 1d8 to determine the entrance, and close off the second entrance on that side. Then roll 1d6 to determine how many of the entrances on the other three sides also lead off somewhere. Use a marker to "seal" the rest off.

When the party Explores to a new area, draw another tile. Roll 1d4 to determine which of the new tile's sides connect, then place it down. Roll 1d6 again to determine how many of the other three sides' exits lead off to new places, and again use a marker to seal the rest off.

For each room visited after the starting room, there is a *cumulative* 1 in 20 chance that one of the exits of the room leads down to the next dungeon level. For the sake of at least *some* kind of consistency in all this insanity, I recommend only having one such lead-down per level. However, if you prefer truly organic creation and are down with more, just reset this count each time one is discovered.

If you somehow happen to "close off" the dungeon using the above methods, without rolling a level exit, either A) add a level exit organically to the last-placed node tile, or B) just accept it as a single-level dungeon and call it good. Not every dungeon needs to be a multi-level descent into the depths of Demon Heck!


### Converting Pre-Made Maps

People like Dyson Logos, Miska Friedman, and Karl Stjernberg (links?) pop out dungeon material at lightning speeds, making them prime sources of dungeon inspiration. If you don't want to make a dungeon on the fly, but don't have time to map out and populate your own from the ground up, here's how to convert an existing one for use as the map for an otherwise randomly-generated HAMMERCRAWL! game.

If the dungeon is already populated, then you're in luck! Use that as the basis for the adventure, and then let the Divining Dice change things on the fly by increasing or decreasing encounters. Pre-populated dungeons are pretty easy to work with, as they give you the basic expectation of what's in there from the beginning, so you already have a stock of options to take inspiration from. You can either use the rooms as-is, or alter them to your liking to fit the party and their level. If you change things up, be sure to set proper Lair Nodes (see above) for periodic increases in challenge.

If the dungeon is not already populated, you'll need to put together an encounter table for it first (see below). And you'll want to determine the Lair Nodes here, as well.

## Random Traps

I use the following roll table for traps. The basic names are cribbed directly from a few hundred test rolls on the Donjon, and then I added my own level-specific rules to use for them instead. I also got rid of Save-or-Die traps because reasons. Most results are based on the dungeon level:

| Roll | Trap                                                                                  |

| 12 | Pendulum Trap (1d6 x 1d6 x level damage)                                                |

# Appendix R: Master List of Randomizers

Here are all of the randomizers that I have found to be most excellent for running HAMMERCRAWL! live and with minimal preparation.

First and foremost, **nothing beats [The Donjon](http://donjon.bin.sh/)** for it's enormous variety of pure randomized awesomeness. This website is the most-used tool in my collection of randomness. It's a vast and comprehensive site with more generators than you could possibly imagine, and I recommend it as the first stop for all your immediate randomizer needs.
