# The Ever-Growing World of the HAMMERCRAWL! RPG

This document serves as a constantly growing guide to the "official" world of the HAMMERCRAWL! RPG. Whenever I run my own games, be they private or recorded, there's always a bit more world establishment that happens as a result, and this master document tracks those new facts.


# World History

(TBD)


## The Really, Really Far Past

(TBD)


## The Somewhat But Not Really All That Far Past

(TBD)


## Recent Times

(TBD)


# Geography

Unsorted:

* The Eleven Mountain Ranges of Doom


# Sociology


## Humans

Humans are by far the most vastly-reaching of the so-called "civilized" people.


### Lands


#### The Province of Doom

Unsorted:

* The Town of Doom, at the Crossroads of Doom
* The Eleven Mountain Ranges of Doom (Doom in the ancient languages just means snow)
* The Gatharbar
* The Sepulchre of Gino


#### The Province of Ted

(TBD)


#### The Town of Testament

Unsorted:

* Run by Mayor Chuck Testa
* Known in the local Legend of Pabrycyg, a local minor deific figure. Pabrycyg was a husky puppy that sacrificed itself to save some families or something like that. His petrified body is on display in town as a statue of great local fame and respect.
* Testament’s local Town Crier is named Yelp, named as such because he is literally unable to speak softly.
* The Barrow of Evil
* The Great Barrow of Evil
* The Dread Barrow of Evil


#### 1997

The distant land of 1997 is known for its diverse colleges and it's plethora of Hottest Topics general stores. The region has a reputation for being a good starting point for many displaced teenaged would-be adventurers, most of which find new adventuring parties at the annual Lollafairuza alternative music festival.


#### Other Places

(TBD)


### Cultural Notes

(TBD)


#### Base-Ball

Unsorted Notes:

* Most popular sport in the lands.
* Two teams play against each other.
* Each time has a Murder Pillar, upon which climbs a Murder Lizard.
* The main defender is known as the Short-Stop. This is because they are bound by rules to only go after the shortest currently-active player on the opposing team. This has led to teams padding their ranks with "token dwarves" in order to keep their opponents' Short-Stops busy.
* Slam Dunking is popular with the larger players.


## Dwarves

Unsorted:

* A type of dwarven miner is a tax collector. They pummel those avoiding collections with pick axes. Tax Collectors ritually shave their beards, but have magnificent mustaches instead.


### Elves

(TBD)


### Halflings

(TBD)


## "Monster" Peoples


### Goblins

Unsorted:

* Goblins are all equivalent in personality to annoying middle school boys.
* Hobgoblins, in turn, are all effectively Bro Teens.
* Bugbears are all effectively swole gym rats.
* Despite their personality issues, the goblins somehow have a massive banking network too, called the Goblin Bank of Wobbly Columns (a nod to comedian Brad Neely).
* Goblins insert the word "Goblin" in front of all names and proper titles, such as "Goblin Clark, the Goblin Cleric of the Goblin God of Goblins"


### Ogres

Unsorted:

* For some reasons, ogres are secretly fetishized in the more remote of Human lands (this is probably due to a certain old pornographer's art zines being distributed to dungeon raiding parties in the Province of Doom). This tends to lead to a number of awkward and ultimately doomed human-ogre romances started via casual encounter scrolls posted on Greg's Listing-boards. These trysts have resulted in a distressing number of single ogre moms and deadbeat human dads, and more than a handful of half-ogre Base Ball teams.


## Deities


### Fairuza Balk, Mistress of the Elements

Fairuza Balk is the name given to the loving Goddess of the Elements, the primary chosen patron of angsty rebellious teenage girls who feel the calling of the clerical ways. Fairuza is an especially popular Goddess in the distant land of 1997, where the locals pay a grand annual tribute to her in the form of the Lollafairuza music festival.


### Gary, God of the Food of the Southern Borderlands

Gary, the God of ??? (Neutral)

Gary is a prolific god in the world. His symbol is a Bell. His holy text is a Taco Bell receipt, preserved from the long-before times.

There are four "Ways" of the Church of Gary, based on the original items in the receipt.

The Churches of Gary frequently house 24-step recovery programs, which have proven excellent sources of would-be adventurers for furthering Gary's causes.


#### Way of the Fresh-ba-Ja

**Main Belief:** (currently undefined)

(TBD)


#### Way of the Chalupa

**Main Belief:** "You must be Soft on the outside, but Crunchy on the inside."

(TBD)


#### Way of the Nacho

**Main Belief:** "You eat the chip you picked."

(TBD)


#### Way of the Taco

**Main Belief:** (currently undefined)

(TBD)


### Gino, God of Pizza

(TBD)


### Gluten

The God Gluten directs his followers to carry forth and Break Bread with the holy, and to destroy all that dares to be gluten-free.


### The Great Goblin God of Goblins

Everyone except the goblins knows that this god is actually just a Halfling in a really awful Goblin mask, but no one has had the heart to tell the Goblins yet, and they’d probably just ritually murder the messenger anyway.


### The Great Yellow Canary

Clerics of the Great Yellow Canary are best known for the giant yellow-feathered bird suits they wear over their armor. Canary Clerics wander the lands, bringing education to children and warring against corporate product placement in dungeons far and wide. The highest-level clerics of the order often ride invisible elephants into battle against the enemies of education.


### John, the Really Cool Dude that Everyone Likes

(TBD; mentioned in Wagoncrawl 2018 Episode #3)


### Other Minor Religions

Local Gods, Folk Deities, etc.

(TBD)


#### Pabrycyg (Town of Testament)

A legendary local husky puppy that sacrificed itself to save human lives. There’s a statue to it in town that some folks pray at. The statue of course is of the horrible burned and mutilated dead body of the dog, because that’s what you do.


# Dungeonography

(TBD)
