# The Ever-Growing World of the HAMMERCRAWL! RPG

This document serves as a constantly growing guide to the "official" world of the HAMMERCRAWL! RPG. Whenever I run my own games, be they private or recorded, there's always a bit more world establishment that happens as a result, and this master document tracks those new facts. I encourage other players of distant games to likewise add their own lore to this ever-blossoming encyclopedia.


# World History

(TBD)


## The Really, Really Far Past

(TBD)


## The Somewhat But Not Really All That Far Past

Rough timeline:

* The first **Lollafairuza** music festival is held in the **Land of 1997**
* The great **Battle of Jiggleton**, a civil war in the land of Jiggleton


## Recent Times

Rough timeline:

* The **Unhappiness Purge of '07** in the land of Jiggleton, which resulted in a fourth of the town of Jigglesworth being ruined


# Geography

Unsorted:

* The **Eleven Mountain Ranges of Doom**


# Sociology


## Peoples

### Humans

Humans are by far the most vastly-reaching of the so-called "civilized" people.


### Demihumans


#### Dwarves

Notes:

* A type of dwarven miner is a tax collector. They pummel those avoiding collections with pick axes. Tax Collectors ritually shave their beards, but have magnificent mustaches instead.


#### Elves

Notes:

* Dwarves frequently refer to elves using the derogatory term **Poops**.


#### Halflings

(TBD)


### Nonhumans


#### Goblins

Unsorted:

* Goblins are all equivalent in personality to annoying middle school boys.
* Hobgoblins, in turn, are all effectively Bro Teens.
* Bugbears are all effectively swole gym rats.
* Despite their personality issues, the goblins somehow have a massive banking network too, called the Goblin Bank of Wobbly Columns (a nod to comedian Brad Neely).
* Goblins insert the word "Goblin" in front of all names and proper titles, such as "Goblin Clark, the Goblin Cleric of the Goblin God of Goblins"


#### Ogres

Unsorted:

* For some reasons, ogres are secretly fetishized in the more remote of Human lands (this is probably due to a certain old pornographer's art zines being distributed to dungeon raiding parties in the Province of Doom). This tends to lead to a number of awkward and ultimately doomed human-ogre romances started via casual encounter scrolls posted on Greg's Listing-boards. These trysts have resulted in a distressing number of single ogre moms and deadbeat human dads, and more than a handful of half-ogre Base Ball teams.



## Polities


### 1996

The realm of **1996** is a tyrannical dystopia that is barely worth further mention in these records, lest others foolishly deem it an interesting place to visit.

But for the sake of completeness, sigh...

Known Locations:

* **Zaramund** is a great metropolis, from which all bureaucracy flows.
* The **Dread Cyst of Terror**, a dungeon in the **Cliffs of Terror**

Known Personages:

* **The Tanners**, a mafia-like organization of tanning salon masters


### 1997

The distant land of **1997** is known for its diverse colleges and it's plethora of Hottest Topics general stores. The region has a reputation for being a good starting point for many displaced teenaged would-be adventurers, most of which find new adventuring parties at the annual **Lollafairuza** alternative music festival.

The denizens of 1997 harbor a particular enmity with the denizens of neighboring kingdom 1996.

Known Locations:

* The **Black Lair of the Vampire Count**, a dungeon
* The **Pit of Tenebrous Worms**, a dungeon

Known Personages:

* **The Vampire Count**, a notoriously sexy but heinously douchey Vampire that all the college students of 1997 want to bang.
* **Philibertus the Vicious**, long dead heinous uncle of the **Vampire Count**. Philibertus died choking on a pudding.
* **The Bad Dragon**, who is in fact a very bad dragon.
* **Bad Biscuits** is a boy band popular in the realm. Their first album was called "Pot Pies."
* **Travel Ossa-Tee** is a group of honorable wandering adventurers that help safely guide other adventuring parties to their destinations.


### The Province of Doom

Far, far, far to the north lies the dismal and cold **Province of Doom**. Key locations:

* The **Eleven Mountain Ranges of Doom**
  - The **Sepulchre of Gino**, a dungeon within the ranges
  - The **Twice-Damned Peaks of Doom**, site of an ancient city of evil long ago smackethed down by The Gods (TM)

**Important note:** "Doom" in the ancient languages just means "snow"


#### The Town of Doom

Built at the **Crossroads of Doom**. Home of the **Gatharbar**, where many adventurers gather to begin their doomy expeditions


### Jiggleton

A land of unbridled and strongly-enforced **Cheer**, ruled by the grimly smiling Church of **Bouncey the Clown**.


#### Jigglesworth

The capital city of **Jiggleton**, and central home of the Church of Bouncey.

Some notes:

* Two of the known ruling noble families are the rival dwarven clans of **Jiggles** and **Squiggles**. Both clans fought against each other in the great **Battle of Jiggleton**.
* One fourth of the "old town" was ruined during the **Unhappiness Purge of '07**, and no one ever got around to rebuilding it. It stands in complete shambles as a reminder of the grim hilarity of life, or something like that. As further punctuation to that joke, dungeons now abound underneath it. One such dungeon, the **Secret Chambers of Evil**, is a known entrance to the legendary mega-dungeon known as the **Wagoncrawl**.



### The Province of Ted

(TBD)


#### The Town of Testament

Located in the Provice of Ted. Key notes:

* Run by **Mayor Chuck Testa**
* Known in the local Legend of **Pabrycyg**, a local minor deific figure. Pabrycyg was a husky puppy that sacrificed itself to save some families or something like that. His petrified body is on display in town as a statue of great local fame and respect.
* Testament’s local **Town Crier** is named **Yelp**, named as such because he is literally unable to speak softly.
* The **Barrow of Evil**
* The **Great Barrow of Evil**
* The **Dread Barrow of Evil**


### Other Places

(TBD)


## Cultural Notes


### Base-Ball

Base-Ball is the most popular sport in the lands.

Misc notes on play:

* Two teams play against each other.
* Each time has two Murder Pillars, upon which climbs a Murder Lizard.
* The main defender is known as the Short-Stop. This is because they are bound by rules to only go after the shortest currently-active player on the opposing team. This has led to teams padding their ranks with "token dwarves" in order to keep their opponents' Short-Stops busy.
* Slam Dunking is popular with the larger players.


## Deities and Religions


### Bouncey the Clown, God of Uncomfortable Cheer (Law)

**Bouncey** is the great clown god, forcing cheer down your throat whether you want it or not.


### Carob, God of Health Food and Flavorlessness (Law)

**Carob** creates an abundance of healthy, tasteless chalk-like food for all that would worship him. Carob is the sworn enemy of **Fireguy**.


### Fairuza Balk, Mistress of the Elements (Neutral)

**Fairuza Balk** is the name given to the loving Goddess of the Elements, the primary chosen patron of angsty rebellious teenage girls who feel the calling of the clerical ways. Fairuza is an especially popular Goddess in the distant land of 1997, where the locals pay a grand annual tribute to her in the form of the Lollafairuza music festival.


### Fireguy, God of Flavor and Also Fire (Chaos)

**Fireguy** rules from the great deific city of Tastytown, in the legendary holy lands of Scrumpt. His clerics serve the best food, and love setting things on fire.

Fireguy is sworn enemy of **Carob**.

Fireguy's clerics are known to bleach their hair to bring them closer to their god. The truly devout sometimes set their hair on fire.


### Gary, God of the Food of the Southern Borderlands (Neutral)

**Gary** is a prolific god in the world. His symbol is a Bell. His holy text is a Taco Bell receipt, preserved from the long-before times.

There are four "Ways" of the Church of Gary, based on the original items in the receipt.

The Churches of Gary frequently house 24-step recovery programs, which have proven excellent sources of would-be adventurers for furthering Gary's causes.


#### Way of the Fresh-ba-Ja

**Main Belief:** To Be perfect, one must be Fresh

A splinter sect that left the orthodox church of Gary after discovering what they refer to as the **New Accords of Freshness**, buried in ancient debris very close to the original site of Gary's first testament. They are known to live by The Freshness, so much so that some cells of this sect have chosen the lifestyle of paleo-cannibalism.

(TBD)


#### Way of the Chalupa

**Main Belief:** "You must be Soft on the outside, but Crunchy on the inside."

(TBD)


#### Way of the Nacho

**Main Belief:** "You eat the chip you picked."

(TBD)


#### Way of the Taco

**Main Belief:** (currently undefined)

(TBD)


### Gino, God of Pizza

(TBD)


### Gluten (Law)

The God **Gluten** directs his followers to carry forth and Break Bread with the holy, and to destroy all that dares to be gluten-free.


### The Great Goblin God of Goblins (Chaos)

Everyone except the goblins knows that **The Great Goblin God of Goblins** is actually just a Halfling in a really awful Goblin mask, but no one has had the heart to tell the Goblins yet, and they’d probably just ritually murder the messenger anyway.


### The Great Yellow Canary (Good)

Clerics of the **Great Yellow Canary** are best known for the giant yellow-feathered bird suits they wear over their armor. Canary Clerics wander the lands, bringing education to children and warring against corporate product placement in dungeons far and wide. The highest-level clerics of the order often ride invisible elephants into battle against the enemies of education.


### John, the Really Cool Dude that Everyone Likes (Good)

(TBD; mentioned in Wagoncrawl 2018 Episode \#3)


### Other Minor Religions

Local Gods, Folk Deities, etc.

(TBD)


#### Pabrycyg (Town of Testament)

A legendary local husky puppy that sacrificed itself to save human lives. There’s a statue to it in town that some folks pray at. The statue of course is of the horrible burned and mutilated dead body of the dog, because that’s what you do.


# Dungeonography

(TBD)


## The Wagoncrawl

A legendary mega-dungeon, said to connect to many (if not all) dungeons across the known world.

Known entrances:

* The **Secret Chambers of Evil**, underneath the town of **Jigglesworth**, in the land of **Jiggleton**
