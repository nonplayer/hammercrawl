# The HAMMERCRAWL! RPG method  

**Created by:** N. Phillip Cole

In the past, HAMMERCRAWL! wasn't meant to be a complete game, but just a method of running "classic"" style games 100% randomly. However, as of Q1 2018, this has changed, and I've decided to write an entire base game for the HAMMERCRAWL! process from the ground up. The older process docs are still here and updated as needed, but I'm now directing most of my efforts on this project toward building on the new base game itself. Expect a lot more in the coming days!

## The Main Files

* **[The HAMMERCRAWL! Core Game System](./hc_complete_rules.md):** This is the new core game, fully compatible with other classic-inspired games currently popular with certain groups, and completely free. It is very much a work in progress, but all the basics are there to be played with.
	- This process works best with my own associated **[Old School Random Character Generator program](https://github.com/nonplayer/OldSchoolCharGen)**, also on GitHub
	- And check out **[the Extended "House Rules" document](./hc_complete_extended.md)** for more ways to customize the game (note: this document is constantly changing and incomplete)
* **[The HAMMERCRAWL! World Bible](./hc_world_bible.md):** This is a reference for the ever-growing official game world of HAMMERCRAWL! and its related podcast should you choose to follow along.
* The HAMMERCRAWL! "Classic" Process: If you have a game already and just want the meta-process, follow these links instead of the core rules:
	- [DM's Guide](./hc_core_dm.md)
	- [Players' Guide](./hc_core_player.md)
* Additional Subsystem Documents:
	- [BECMI / Dark Dungeons](./hc_becmi.md)
	- [Dungeon Crawl Classics](./hc_dcc.md)
	- [Labyrinth Lord](./hc_lablord.md)

## The Generators

**Note:** Any generator tools deemed to be system-specific are being moved into relevant sub docs.

These are the Generators that I use most often, so am linking them here for quick access:

* [My own self-written Old School Randomizer](https://github.com/nonplayer/OldSchoolCharGen) - I'll start by tooting my own horn here, but I'm continually working on this tool to try and get it to do everything I need for this project and more beyond.
* [The Donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh/) - Almost everything you will ever need! I use this a lot, here are my main tabs:
	- [Party Names](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=setting;setting=Party)
	- [Dungeon Names](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=setting;setting=Dungeon)
