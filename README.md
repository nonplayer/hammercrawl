# The HAMMERCRAWL! RPG method  

**Created by:** N. Phillip Cole

This document collection presents a "return to form" for the HAMMERCRAWL! game method. Over the decade-plus that I've run it, HAMMERCRAWL! has taken on a vast array of system morphs, from guidelines to method to even a full attempt at a ground-up new system. Now I'm bringing it back to its roots and redoubling my focus on improving the core method, so that it can be more easily applied to a wider variety of game systems.

If for whatever reason you want to see the old attempt at a new system, switch the branch to 2E instead of classic.
