# A Player's Guide to HAMMERCRAWL!

This document serves as a Player's guide to staying alive during the **HAMMERCRAWL!** process. There is more behind-the-scenes data in the Smith's Guide, while this document focuses specifically on your role at the table.

For the most part, the general play of the game is handled according to the rules of the game system you are playing. This document details specific overrides put in place to better facilitate randomized old-school play.


# Characters


## Naming Your Character

We've discovered that the *absolute most* fun is had by having other players name your character. So once you've drawn up your random character, pass them to the left, right, or anywhere really, and have a different player give them a name.


## Determine Party (Player) Roles

Hopefully the rest of your group has been making your characters alongside one another, and you've now all reached this point together. It's time to determine the party roles, which are mainly for administration and also for the use of the special new Party Actions.

**The Roles to Assign:**

* **Party Leader:** This player is responsible for choosing Initiative orders, and for informing the Hammersmith when the party moves on or takes any of the Party Actions.
* **Mapper:** This player is responsible for translating the Hammersmith's descriptions to a map that the party can use, in whatever artistic fashion the player sees fit.
* **Timekeeper:** This player tracks the passage of game Beats, and keeps track of who is carrying what light sources (and how much time is left on them). Dyson's [Torch Cards](https://rpgcharacters.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/hand-tooled-dccrpg-character-sheets/) might come in handy here.
* **Lootkeeper:** This player records all the loot found on the adventure.


## Your Character's Inevitable Demise

When you die, your gear becomes party loot. Each item has a 50% (use a d6) chance of being made worthless and useless by your death, however!

Draw a new character from the pile! You arrive either one Turn or one Round later, whichever makes more sense or seems more exciting.

For added fun. draw a tombstone on the back of your character sheet, and give the character a fitting epitaph.

If the dead character was party leader, the group needs to elect a new leader! If this is instantaneous, then move on. However if there is any debate or argument on the role, **it takes one turn of game time** - mark off those lights!


## Don't forget Food and Lights!

Before you head off on your trek, you should make special note that Food and Lights are extremely important to survival in the HAMMERCRAWL! experience. Dungeons are dark and scary places, and most characters can't see in the dark. Without light, you can't act, nor can you camp! Similarly, Food is required in order to camp as well. No food? No camp action. Camping in this system is an *extremely* beneficial resource for the party, so be sure to manage your light and food accordingly!

To better keep track of your light sources, I highly recommend making use of the awesome custom [Torch Cards][] from Dyson Logos. There are lanterns there too! They make great tools for tracking the countdown of lights.


## Managing Loot and XP

The characters will gain XP from encounters they defeat, and hopefully loot as well. XP earned from encounters is immediately applied to the character sheet.

Using some traditional old school game rules, monetary loot also counts as XP - but in HAMMERCRAWL!, that XP is only applied *after* the heroes make it back to town with the loot. So when loot is acquired, write down the loot and its value, but do not count it as XP just yet. Heroes can also convert a fraction of the loot to XP as a Camp Action, but this wastes the vast majority of it.


## Using Skills

Skills are handled as one would expect in the base game being played. Since HAMMERCRAWL! is written primarily with "old school" games in mind, this means that the method expects the same kind of old school mentalities to apply when using "skills" in play.

If you are new to this concept, I recommend starting with the ["Quick Primer for Old School Gaming"](http://www.lulu.com/items/volume_63/3019000/3019374/1/print/3019374.pdf) as a good introductory read.

In short, in "old school" style play, the characters are all assumed to be able to do a great number of things that aren't otherwise specifically written on their character sheets, *provided* they have a reasonable amount of time to do so. For just a few examples, given a low-stress situation (as in "not being actively stabbed by murder trees and melted by acid goblins") and appropriate time to accomplish, the following assumptions can be made:

* Fighters and Thieves can climb a wall or barrier with assumed handholds.
* Wizards and Priests can decipher ancient tomes through extended study.
* A character from a woodsman background can tell if a plant is poisonous or not.
* Anyone unencumbered and without clanky bits can walk slowly and silently for a bit.
* ...and so on

Again, these are just some basic examples of assumptions that can be made. When there is a question of complexity and/or added danger, use one or more (or all!) of the following basic guidelines:


#### Is time a factor worth considering in this moment?

If so, let them perform the task without a roll, but let them know it takes one or more turns of time to accomplish. This can diminish light sources and spell durations, and also affect the exploration dice pools!


#### Is there a chance of a dangerous complication?

This includes things such as "they might hurt themselves" or such. If so, incorporate a basic Ability Check (d20 roll-under). Either way they succeed at the task, but with a failed roll they also suffer a setback, such as:

* HP loss (1 to 1d4 points maybe)
* Equipment loss
* Injury or such resulting in Temporary penalty to near-future die rolls
* an added challenge die to the next exploration pool
* alerting nearby enemies
* some other appropriate environmental response


#### Is there a chance of failure?

This one's a tough call, because again, these are supposed to be capable adventurers. If you truly feel that the feat is a tough enough that they might not succeed, first let them know this in your own preferred DM narrative way. Try to encourage them to offer new strategies to overcome the task, fall-back plans, or complete reassessment of the situation.

If they still persist, as above have them roll an associated ability check. With a failed roll, they both fail the task *and* suffer some complication from above. Sucks, but they knew the risks before they rolled!


### "Thief Skills"

**However**, certain characters (Thieves, Specialists, etc) get very specific skills written down on their character sheets. The general approach to these skills is to only require them to be rolled against when the situation seems otherwise impossible, when the odds are visibly and obviously stacked against them. Each Thief skill has built into it the assumption that something really bad might happen if it fails. If you're not willing to make that bad thing happen, then what's the point of making the thief roll in the first place?


### Other Skills (Proficiencies, etc)

If your flavor of game has skill proficiencies built into it for all characters, the assumption here is that simply *having* the skill in the first place means that you can just do it most of the time, no roll needed. You would only need to roll for those skills when you wanted or needed to do something truly spectacular with them.


## Fighting Things (Combat Rounds)

Combat flows as normal for the base game's rules. HAMMERCRAWL! adds the following new special action(s):

* **Loot Fallen Ally**


### New Personal Action: Loot Fallen Ally

During active combat, a character can take any one readily-accessible item from a fallen ally as an action. Any more in-depth looting must wait until the action is over and the danger clear.

*After* combat, multiple PCs may wish to loot their ally at the same time. Handle this as a special kind initiative. Roll off as usual, and then on their turn a PC may take either one specific item or 1d4 random items.

Money loot from fallen allies is always split evenly among the survivors, unless they otherwise work something else out among themselves.


# HUZZAH! (The Explore Action)

Each dungeon will likely consist of multiple levels, with many rooms among them. Each room can contain numerous horrible dangers, but also a good chance at wondrous loot as well. Moving from room to room requires exploration, which invites danger but also creates opportunity for new treasures and rewards!

In order to continue exploring the Dungeon, your party leader must tell the DM that your group is moving on to the next Room - be sure to discuss tactics and approaches before you move! Moving to the next room in this fashion initiates the **Explore Action** and tells the DM that it's time to roll the dungeon die and the Divining Pool. The rules for divining the Explore Action are in the DM's Document.

**TIME:** The Explore action requires a minimum of 1 turn of time, so have light sources ready!


# Camping (The Camp Action)

The party Leader can choose to take a Camp Action at any location deemed a **Safe Haven**. These are discovered when the DM announces them as such, usually through the roll of net Falcons in the Divining Pool. This requires Light and Rations, however.

To take a Camp Action

**TIME:** The action takes a minimum of 6 Turns (1 hour; light is required and spent accordingly unless the *entire* party can see in the dark)

**REQUIRES:** 1 Ration Each (expended)

First, **EACH CHARACTER DOES THE FOLLOWING FOR FREE:** (based on *Dark Dungeons* character classes)

* **Cleric, Magic-User:** Re-memorize 1 daily spell.
* **Dwarf, Fighter, Halfling, Mystic, and Thief:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs.
* **Elf:** Either re-memorize 1 daily spell *or* recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs.

*System Note:* If using a different system, adjust accordingly, giving primary spellcasters a spell back, and hybrids a choice.

Then, **EACH PLAYER PICKS ONE** additional camp action:

* **Rest:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs (or the second half, if doubling up from the free action above), but also use one additional Ration.
* **Re-Memorize:** Recover one previously-spent daily spell use per character level.
* **Invest:** Convert one-fourth (rounded up) of their current financial loot value to immediate character XP (1GP = 1XP exchange), marking that loot off of the character sheet. Leveling up requires a separate action, however...
* **Craft Ammo:** Add 2d4 normal arrows for your bow/crossbow, or collect as many stones for your sling.
* **Level up!:** If the hero has enough XP to reach the next level, they can apply the effects of that level as a Camp Action. This adds a Hit Die, as well as any other new-level bonuses. Note that it does not heal existing HP loss or restore used spells or abilities (those are separate Camp Actions, above).
* **Stand Watch:** Add a Green Die to the next room explored, and -1 to GM's camp encounter roll (below).
* **Scout Ahead:** Roll Search (or other system-appropriate check). If successful, add one Yellow die to next 1d4 new rooms explored. If failed, add Black dice instead.

Finally, **DM ROLLS 1d6:**

* Subtract 1 for each party member Standing Watch
* Add the current Dungeon Level

If total is 6+, an encounter happens while they camp! Roll as usual to generate a standard encounter. If none of the PCs chose to Stand Watch, then they are also surprised!

If an encounter occurs during camp, the Time and Rations are still spent, and all other chosen Camp Actions still occur. Resolve them before beginning the encounter initiative checks.


# Returning Home (The Town Action)

When the heroes finally return to town (which likely involves backtracking through the dungeon to their original exit), the following happens, in order:

* Restore HP to Max, and relearn daily Spells and Powers.
* OPTIONAL: Each player can choose to spend any amount of their loot to acquire better goods at the DM's allowance. This could take time, though, so you might want to skip it in Con and One-Shot games. 
* If their loot value is enough to level them up, apply just enough to level them up and discard the rest as having been spent on R&R and upkeep.
* Apply any effects of character leveling.
* If their loot value is not enough to level them up, apply half of it as XP and discard the rest as having been spent on R&R and upkeep. You shouldn't have left the dungeon so soon!
* Restore their standard starting equipment list to full original capacity.
* Return to the Dungeon!


# APPENDICES


## APPENDIX R: Random Character Components

The following lists of random traits and skills and such have been a growing and well-loved component of my HAMMERCRAWL! games for years now. The lists' contents are a hodge podge of things take from books, programs, and our own continued additions as they arise in play. They add an element of silliness that isn't for everyone, so I've included them here in the appendices as an option.


### Random Character Tags

Roll 1d400 (figure it out) once and consult the table below. If you're feeling adventurous, roll twice and keep both.

### Random Character Class (and stats)

Want to randomly pick your class, and then also ensure that you at least have some stats that match it? Use this system. Note that this is still using data from the prior HAMMERCRAWL! game system. It will eventually be updated for other games.

Roll 3d6, and then consult the following table:

| Roll  | Class             |
|-------|-------------------|
| 3-4   | Elf Exemplar      |
| 5-7   | Dwarf Defender    |
| 8-13  | Human*            |
| 14-16 | Halfling Burglar  |
| 17-18 | Half-ogre Berserker |

\*If human, roll 1d4 to determine your actual class:

1. Cleric
2. Fighter
3. Magic-User
4. Thief

**Note:** These tables are for a primarily humanocentric fantasy setting, such as that established in The OG. Adjust these as needed for your campaign setting.

Now roll 3d6 seven times, and write them down in order (**NOTE:** The previous game system added a seventh stat for Social Status, or SOC).

*Example: Darla rolls 3d6 seven times and writes them down in the order she rolled them: 9, 14, 11, 10, 5, 17, and 6.*

**First** assign your highest rolls *in order of their rolling* to the Prime Stats of your character class. Most classes should have two Prime Stats, some only one, and maybe others three. However many, take the highest rolls from your set in the order they were rolled, and assign them to the Prime Stats in the order they appear on the character sheet.

*Example: Since Darla rolled a Fighter in the first step, she notes that her class's Prime Stats are STR and CON. Darla's highest-rolled stats are 14 and 17. Assigning them in the order rolled, she notes that her new Fighter now has a STR of 14 and a CON of 17.*

**Next** assign the remaining rolls *in order of their rolling* to the remaining empty stats on your character sheet.

*Example: Darla's remaining rolls are 9, 11, 10, and 5. She assigns them in order to her Fighter's remaining stats, which results in a final spread of: STR 14, DEX 9, CON 17, INT 11, WIS 10, CHA 5, SOC 6.*

**Finally** record the stat mods next to each one, using the following table:

| Stat  | Mod |
|-------|-----|
| 3     | -3  |
| 4-5   | -2  |
| 6-8   | -1  |
| 9-12  | 0   |
| 13-15 | +1  |
| 16-17 | +2  |
| 18    | +3  |


### Random Languages

Some characters begin the game knowing additional bonus languages. Roll 1d30 for each, and consult the following table. If you double up on a language, you speak that language as if you were born to it. If you triple up, you also know all rare dialects of it, should they come up in play.

| Roll | Language         | Roll | Language         |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
| 1    | Celestial (Law)  | 16   | Goblin           |
| 2    | Dragon           | 17   | Grimlock         |
| 3    | Drow             | 18   | Halfling         |
| 4    | Druidic          | 19   | Infernal (Chaos) |
| 5    | Dwarf            | 20   | Kobold           |
| 6    | Elemental, Air   | 21   | Manticore        |
| 7    | Elemental, Earth | 22   | Medusa           |
| 8    | Elemental, Fire  | 23   | Naga             |
| 9    | Elemental, Water | 24   | Ogre             |
| 10   | Elf              | 25   | Ophidian         |
| 11   | Esperanto        | 26   | Orc              |
| 12   | Giant            | 27   | Pidgin (special) |
| 13   | Gibberish        | 28   | Pigeon           |
| 14   | Gnoll            | 29   | Sylvan           |
| 15   | Gnome            | 30   | Teenager         |

**Pidgin:** If you roll Pidgin, randomly roll two more languages (reroll if you get Pidgin or a language you already know). You now speak both of them very badly.


### Random Money and Gear

(**NOTE:** Originally inspired by The Nightmares Underneath, this sub-system is based on the previous incarnation's SOC stat.)

Multiply your rolled SOC score by its associated multiplier, and that's how much money you have to spend. Use the Equipment section of this book to purchase anything you can afford.

| SOC (3d6) | Coins | Status           |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| 3         | x0*   | Scum             |
| 4-5       | x10   | Peasantry        |
| 6-8       | x15   | Poor             |
| 9-12      | x20   | Middle Class     |
| 13-15     | x25   | Lesser Nobility  |
| 16-17     | x30   | Greater Nobility |
| 18        | 1000* | Royalty          |


#### A Note on Royalty

You read that right, Royalty is rich as fuck and starts with 1000 coins. Enjoy the comforts of a shitload of money, buy all the things you want, and see how long that works out for you down there in that awful, horrible, no-good dungeon...


#### A Note on Scum

If you are lucky enough to roll into Scum as your social status, do not dismay, for you may have just lucked out. Enjoy three completely random rolls on the 'Smith's magic items tables. These are guaranteed to not survive your character's final death, and as such cannot be looted from your body.


### Random Skills

For groups that want to randomize everything, use this table for skill choices. Roll 1d20 + 1d100 for each skill, and consult the table below:

### Random Weird "Item"

Roll 1d50 to determine what your random weird item is. Some of these may not make sense as items, but trust me, they are. Keep them wherever you like, they require no encumbrance, and they can be looted (sometimes unwillingly!) upon your death. Have fun with them.

### Random Wizard Weapons

(These are rules from the previous incarnation of the game, and will need to be adjusted to fit yours).

Magic-Users (and *only* Magic-Users) have access to a special class of "common" magic items commonly referred to as **Wizard Weapons**. Owing mainly to their renowned squishiness in adventuring parties, wizards across the known world have developed specialist weapons that allow them a chance of contributing more to their adventures than just a handful of spells each day.

There are two specific types of Wizard Weapons in HAMMERCRAWL!: battle wands and battle staves. A **Battle Wand** is a custom-crafted piece of short-range artillery that functions almost identical to a sling in basic combat mechanics. They are Medium one-handed weapons that do normal Hit Die-based damage at 80/160 range, and use INT as their attack modifier. They have effectively infinite ammo, but on an attack roll of natural 1 they fizzle out. To recharge a fizzled battle wand, the magic-user must "sacrifice" one of their currently-known spells to empower the wand, forgetting that spell until rememorized.

A **Battle Staff** is meant as more of a defensive item. It functions as a basic Staff for purposes of combat attacks. If a magic-user take a Defensive Action (see Combat rules) while wielding a Battle Staff, their Defense is raised by their current XP level until their next action (in addition to the normal Banes applied by the action). If hit by a natural 20 attack, the staff is drained of defensive power, and must be recharged using a method identical to that for charging battle wands.

Each battle wand and staff is a unique item, from the base components of its crafting to the energy it exudes. Use the table below to randomly determine the properties of yours.
