title: Hammercrawl! Complete Game - Extended Rules Options

# Extend Your Dungeon Crawl

It's a common occurrence, you know: designers house-ruling the games that they themselves wrote. It happens so often that when you play a demo game run by that game's designer, nine times out of ten you're playing with their own unpublished house rules already. What makes it even funnier in this case is that HAMMERCRAWL! itself is really just my own assembled house rules for *other* games as it is. House rules for house rules, when will the madness end?!

This document contains my own extended "house rules" for the core HAMMERCRAWL! game engine. Some of these *could* have been considered basic enough to include in the core document, but in the spirit of keeping that game more or less "classic" in feel, I moved them here instead.

What you'll find within:

* New Alternate Classes and Options
* *Near-constant* beta-quality updates to the content

#### Goblin Acrobat Trio (alternate Halfling Burglar)

Traveling goblin acrobats are an increasingly common spectacle in the frontier lands, and they are even just now starting to occasionally make their way to the bigger cities of the Civilised Lands. Your character is actually *three* such skilled acrobats, for while a single goblin may be too weak and unmotivated to be an adventurer, they can be much more capable in numbers.

* **Prime Stats:** DEX
* **Hit Dice:** 1d4 and Special (See below)
* **Attack Rank:** C: You add 1/3 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 20
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Area (Advantage), Luck
  - **Okay:** Rally, Death
  - **Bad:** Mind, Body
* **Gear Restrictions:** ???
* **Bonus Languages:** Goblin
* **Bonus Equipment:** A long hooded cloak.

**SPECIAL Creation Notes:** A Goblin Acrobat Trio is actually *three* (3) goblins that work together as a team. This creates a whole new range of role-playing possibilities, and also requires a bit of modification to the character creation and management process.

* **Stat Rolls:** Each of the three goblins rolls a single 1d6 for each of its six stats. Assign the highest to DEX, and then the rest in order of their rolls. It helps to write them in a 3 columns by 6 rows grid.
* **Basic Actions:** The goblins can act together or separately. An individual goblin uses its own low base stats (and likewise low stat mods). When they work together, they combine their stats directly and then use the combined totals to determine the final derived mods.
* **Hit Dice, Hit Points, and Death:** The Trio's base HD is a d4, and their combined Hit Points are modified by the final derived CON mod. This total applies whether they are together or separated, and covers the entire Trio at once.
* **Combat Actions:** On their Combat turn, the Trio gets only a single action

**Small But Also Tall:** A Trio that takes up the same space can stand foot-to-shoulder as tall as a human. They can also separate to fit through smaller spaces individually.

**Strength in Numbers:** TBD

**Goblin Death:** When the Trio's HP total is reduced to Zero, one of the Goblins of the Trio has unfortunately been killed. Either choose the most logical Goblin based on the circumstances of the damage, or roll randomly.

**Replacing a Dead Goblin:** TBD

**Goblin "Magic":** Goblin Acrobat Trios are spellcasters, of sorts. Starting at level 1 and again with each new level, they gain one random spell from the level 1 Magic-User list, modified as listed below. These are cast as normal spells, using all standard spellcasting rules.

* **Goblin Analyze:** TBD
* **Goblin Charm Person:** TBD
* **Goblin Magic Missile:** Range 60ft, Damage 3d4. All three goblins hop down and pelt their target with rocks and insults.
* **Goblin Read Magic:** TBD
* **Goblin Sleep:** Range 20 ft. All three goblins run through the target area, throwing sleeping powder in the targets' faces.
* etc...

#### Vulterran Scout (alternate Half-ogre Berserker)

Lanky wolf-men of the Great Northern Reach, Vulterran Scouts are rarely seen in the lands of Humankind and its allies. The Northlands are largely seen as barbaric wilds by the "civilised" Kingdoms of Humans, but there are actually rich cultures with long-reaching histories, mostly unknown to all residents South of their harsh bounds. Vulterran Scouts range into the lands of Humans, seeking information, allies, and potential targets of eventual raid and conquest.
