HAMMERCRAWL! System Appendix: BECMI

A document for using the HAMMERCRAWL! method with the "BECMI" variant of D&D, and its related retroclones. For reference purposes, this document deals entirely with the _[Dark Dungeons](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/72635/dark-dungeons)_ retroclone, from Gratis Games.

One of the main goals of the process is to play older games while reducing book-checking. To that end, I've instituted a number of house rules to simplify play for fun and speed. Think of these as my system-specific House Rules for use when Hammercrawling.

# Character Advancement

**First and foremost**, multiply all base encounter XP rewards by 10, across the board. This is a game of rapid progression through dangerous dungeons, and faster XP gain is a bit more entertaining. This multiplier *does not* apply to *any* other sources of XP.

## Changes when Leveling Up

* **Saving Throws:** Instead of following progression tables, upon attaining a new level a player is allowed to reduce any two of their character's saving throws by 1 point each, to a final minimum of 2.
* **Thief Skills:** Instead of following a progression table, allow the thief to add +40 points to his skills every level as he sees fit, with nothing increasing more than 20% per level.
