# A Dungeon Master's Guide to HAMMERCRAWL!

This document serves as a DM's guide to running the **HAMMERCRAWL!** process. The HAMMERCRAWL! method uses a set of special "Meta-Actions" to completely randomize an old-school "Dungeon Crawl" experience. This method is based on the assumption that at the core of every good Dungeon Crawl are the following five components:

1. Player Characters (see the [Player's Guide](./hc_core_player.md) for PC-specific information)
2. A Dungeon (and Maps)
3. Encounters (both combat and non-)
4. Traps
5. Treasure

The HAMMERCRAWL! method uses multiple randomizers to provide these core elements on the fly, for as close to a 100% procedurally-generated game experience as possible.

Aside from numerous digital generators, the core *physical* tools used in this are a full set of [Dungeonmorph][] Dice and/or cards, a full set of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition special dice, and an array of mostly-online random generators.

HAMMERCRAWL! is not meant to be a core game system. Instead it is my own custom-compiled home-rules method for running "Old School" dungeon crawl style games with 100% game randomization. Characters, dungeon rooms, encounters, and more - all are generated randomly. It works best with games that favor this kind of dungeon play.

I've recently begun to separate the more system-specific rules and notes into their own sub-documents, linked in [this project's README](./README.md). Most of this main document was written primarily with the game [Dark Dungeons][] in mind, and extended rules for that system are in the linked document as well.


# THE TOOLS OF HAMMERCRAWL!

## The Core Role-Playing Game System

HAMMERCRAWL! is primarily intended to be used with "old school" role-playing games - that is, modern games that are remakes, retroclones, or otherwise tributes to the "old school" expectations of early (1970s-1980s) official variants of Dungeons and Dragons. This means the classic spread of six broad ability scores, five weird saving throws, a very small assortment of character classes (including "race as class" options popular at those times), and a whole mess of seemingly unfair and totally deadly traps.

While this method is definitely aimed at old school games, they aren't a hard requirement. Really, all you need is a "hardcore" style of dungeon crawl with maximum randomization built into as many aspects of its play structure. There are other games out there that do this, but usually it is the "retroclone" catalog that does it best.

The *most* compatible games are those with built-in randomization of treasure, encounters, reactions, and more. For me, systems with treasure tables go to the top of the list of options, putting those derived from either B/X, BECMI, or AD&D as my primary candidates. This is because for me, the complete randomization of treasure is a crucial part of the experience, and thus systems that only give loose guidelines and expect the DM to do all the work of treasure assignment don't fit the bill.

## The Randomizers

This method focuses entirely on spontaneous, random play, and as such you're going to need a buttload of Random Generator tools. A good number of these are linked in [the base Readme file](./README.md) as well as the system-specific sub-files therein.

## The Divining Dice

I use a set of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition dice to serve as a way to "divine" the results of the party's actions. Hell, this all really started because I had a bunch of these dice left over from getting rid of my WFRP3 set, and wanted to find a way to keep using them in other games.

To quickly run through the dice, with WFRP3 you get a mix of seven different types of dice, coded by color: Blue, Yellow, White, Green, Red, Black, and Purple. Each of these colors represents a different purpose, such as Challenge, Luck, Fortune, Skull, and so on. Their different faces have symbols instead of numerical pips, which you can use to divine the outcomes of tests in that game. For this game, the dice translate as:

* **Blue: The Reward Die** - rolled to find new fortunes and treasure.
* **Red: The "Huzzah!" Die** - rolled when the heroes are especially brave and/or foolhardy.
* **Green: The Caution Die** - rolled to reward careful strategy and conversation.
* **White: The Luck Die** - added to the pool for good ideas and plans.
* **Black: The Dark Die** - added when the players' own actions turn against them.
* **Yellow: The Die of Expertise** - representing solid applied skill and craft.
* **Purple: The Die of Challenge** - Purple dice can bring great danger and peril, but amplify XP!

Don't have dice of your own? [Use the Broken Tome generator!](http://brokentome.com/tools/DiceRoller.aspx)

## Other Things You Need to Track

I just use a graph paper notebook for these, or a OneNote book:

* Character list (player names, PC names, classes, AC)
* Dungeon Level Exit Roll Tally
* Death List


# GAME SETUP!

First off, you need some players. I think this process works best with 1 GM and no more than 5 players.

You then need the basic tools.

Then you need to print off a stack of characters using any of the recommended generators. I suggest a stack of 50, that should last you a few games.

Designate one player character to be the **Party Leader**!

Have the party leader pick the Difficulty Level of the dungeon, from the three options below. These set the base Divining Pool for the Explore actions:

1. Normal: Only a single Purple die is used for the Divining Pool, XP rewards are normal.
2. Hardcore: 2 Purple Dice are used in the Divining Pool, XP rewards are doubled (x2).
3. IRON MAN! 3 Purple Dice are used in the Divining Pool, XP rewards are quintupled (x5)

Finally, see below for details on the "Big Five" Components necessary to your Dungeon Crawl experience.

## Generating the Characters

The hard way to do this is to manually roll every character by hand. Personally I prefer to use automated generators. Some of these are linked in the README, and others are linked in the individual sub-system documents.

## Generating the Dungeon

To generate Dungeon rooms, I initially used a set of Dungeonmorph dice and their matching blue-and-white cards (the latter kept into handy dry-erase sleeves). They even come with little symbols and a handy key to them, for adding more spontaneous dungeon features on the fly.

Since starting this project, I've streamlined my process to use only the cards, saving the dungeon dice for more extreme one-off cases. The basic process involves going from room to room, encountering obstacles, grabbing treasure, and moving ever onward. When it's time to move to a new room, I grab one of the the dungeon cards and lay it out as the next room. The pieces are all laid out on the table, and the dungeon grows dynamically as the players explore it.

Conversely, the [Donjon][] site has an extremely detailed set of random dungeon generators. Using them to pre-build your dungeon can save a lot of time at the table for playing. You can do the same with the dice and cards, too.

There are two basic approaches to Dungeon Generation. You can certainly do so on the fly (described below in the "Explore Actions" section). That can add some slow-down to a live play session, however, so I've provided tips on building it in advance, as well. While this does partially-defeat the whole "100% random" approach to play that is encouraged by this gaming method, I admit that the dungeon can be the trickiest thing to build on the fly, and the most time-consuming. To save on time, pre-designing a dungeon is pretty simple using the random dungeon generators at the [Donjon][]. Hell, it can even pre-plan encounters, saving you the need to roll for the enemy types in your divining pool!

### Building the Dungeon on the Fly

This is detailed further below in the Explore Action rules, where it occurs during play.

### Pre-Game Dungeon-Building with Dungeonmorph Cards

If you have a set of Dungeonmorph cards, you can instead use my personal method for pre-game dungeon generation. This saves time in play if you have it in advance, and creates some pretty interesting setups.

Tools required are:

* A shuffled stack of Dungeonmorph tiles. I have 90 of them, in dry-erase sleeves, with the tops trimmed off to make placement easier.
* Dice: you need a d3, d4, d6, and d8. Last two really only for occasional exit checks. These could also be simplified to a d6 and d8 as well.
* Dry erase markers: Black, Green, and Red

With those prepared, then determine the number of "nodes" (tiles) for the current dungeon level: Level + 5 + 3d4.

For the entrance, pull the top card and set it out. Roll 1d8 to determine which of the eight exists is the entrance to the dungeon. Mark the entrance with a Green Dot.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which of the remaining sides of the currently-placed tile to add the next tile to.

Draw the next dungeon tile and add it to the side determined. Roll 1d4 to determine which side of the new tile connects. Rotate accordingly and lay it down so the new side connects to the the prior card.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which exits on that side connect through to the previous card: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both. Use a black marker to mark out blocked ways, if applicable.

Repeat process, building out the dungeon to the pre-rolled number of rooms. Sometimes sides will be pre-filled as the dungeon rolls back into itself. In those cases, adjust the base 1d3 to different die sizes to fit accordingly.

Whenever a new tile connects to a previously-laid one _other than_ the most recent, roll 1d4 to determine if any of that previous tile's exits on that side connect to the new tile: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both, 4 = none! use a black marker to mark through blocked passages, if any.

If a tile is placed in a fashion that leaves it with no available spaces to add the next tile, place the next tile in the next best available side of the previous tile, and so on.

The last tile placed has the exit to the next level. Randomly roll which exit gets this distinction, and then mark the exit with a Red Dot

When finished, use a black marker to fill in the "dead exits" on the tiles as makes the most sense for the dungeon you have built.

Once you have the flow mastered, this process takes no more than 5-10 minutes per dungeon level. Since even a single level can play host to a multitude of game sessions, you most likely only really need one or two, tops. With 90 available tiles, the scenery remains fresh for many sessions of adventuring.

#### (Optional) Setting Lair Nodes

A "Lair Node" is a tile where a guaranteed Lair Fight will occur. These will have larger encounter numbers, and most likely pose great challenges to the players. Choosing their locations in advance can give you a bit more freedom and strategy mid-session when guiding the game proper.

Each level of the Dungeon should have a number of Lair Nodes equal to the level of the dungeon + 1d4. The easiest way to place them is to just look at the dungeon you have created, and place them in the mist interesting-looking, lair-like tiles. Otherwise, divide the number of tiles by the number of lairs, and then roughly space them out every X tiles. Placing a lair on the exit tile is usually a fun setup!

Do not pre-populate the denizens of these Lair Nodes! Instead, let the random encounter generate them for you when discovered by the players.

## Generating the Encounters

Every game system that I'm focusing on *should* have its own encounter generator. See the system-specific sub-documents for more details.

## Generating the Traps

I use the following roll table for traps. The basic names are cribbed directly from a few hundred test rolls on the [Donjon][], and then I added my own level-specific rules to use for them instead. I also got rid of Save-or-Die traps because reasons:

| Roll | Trap                                                                                  |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Acid Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                          |
| 2  | Arrow Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                         |
| 3  | Blinding Gas Trap                                                                       |
| 4  | Elevator Room Trap (descends 1 level)                                                   |
| 5  | Falling Block Trap (1d6 x 1d6 x level damage)                                           |
| 6  | Falling Ceiling Trap (1d10 x 1d10 x level damage)                                       |
| 7  | Fire Trap (1d6 damage)                                                                  |
| 8  | Flooding Pit Trap (1d6 x 10 x level feet, 1d6 damage per 10 ft.)                        |
| 9  | Flooding Room Trap                                                                      |
| 10 | Lightning Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                     |
| 11 | Net Trap                                                                                |
| 12 | Pendulum Trap (1d6 x 1d6 x level damage)                                                |
| 13 | Pit Trap (1d6 x 10 x level feet, 1d6 damage per 10 ft.)                                 |
| 14 | Poison Dart Trap (1d4 damage plus poison; onset 1d8-1 rounds, save or level x10 damage) |
| 15 | Poison Gas Trap (onset 1d8-1 rounds, save or level x10 damage)                          |
| 16 | Scythe Trap (1d6 x 1d6 x level damage)                                                  |
| 17 | Sleep Gas Trap                                                                          |
| 18 | Spear Trap (1d8 x level damage)                                                         |
| 19 | Spiked Pit Trap (1d6 x 10 x level feet, 1d8 damage per 10 ft.)                          |
| 20 | Teleporter Trap                                                                         |


## Generating the Treasure

As mentioned before, this method works best with game systems that have built-in treasure tables that allow complete randomization of treasure. The only games that I know of that specifically do this are B/X, BECMI, AD&D 1e, AD&D 2e, and their associated retroclones and variants. If you know of others, please update me!

Please be careful when using pre-published treasure table randomizers! While B/X and BECMI use the same basic alphabetized tables, they are deceptively similar to AD&D, which also uses an alphabetized table. However, the latter's table options are completely different than those of the former, with drastically rearranged values. **Do not** use AD&D treasure table generators with B/X and BECMI, and vice-versa! I learned this the hard (but very hilarious) way in a demo game once, and while the results were quite fun, the game took a completely different turn at that point.

# DUNGEON CRAWLING!

Running the Dungeon is primarily a process of listening and responding. Use the group's **Explore Actions** to build the Dungeon and randomize its contents. Use their **Camp Actions** to allow them a brief respite from the dangers that surround them. Finally, use their Town Actions to level them up and let them re-stock their supplies.

What you do outside of all of this is up to you. It *is* a role-playing game, after all, so run it otherwise as you would your game of choice!

## Explore Actions

What to do when the players choose a new Explore Action:

### (OPTIONAL) Build Out the Dungeon

**NOTE:** If you're using a pre-built dungeon to save time, skip this step.

When the players choose to move to the next room with an Explore Action, it's time to build the dungeon. For years I would use a combination of matching cards and dice from Dungeonmorph, but recently I've streamlined my method to use only the cards. You can use whatever method you prefer, but I've made notes on two options below.

#### The Dungeonmorph Dice Method

If you truly want a simple one shot, run-and-go, never-to-return method, use this one. There are 15 Dungeonmorph dice available for this task, each one a different theme of location.

To use this method, put them all into a bag, and pull one out at random. This one is the starting Node of the dungeon. Randomly determine which of the eight entrances is the actual dungeon entrance, and note it down.

Then, roll ALL the remaining dice at once, *except for one* - that's right, leave one in the bag. Take all the rolled dice and just assemble them willy-nilly like a wild-person, pushing them up against each other until you have one crazy-looking dungeon. Make sure the entrance die is on the outside.

Finally, roll that last die, add it somewhere interesting, and note it as the Exit to the next level. You now have yourself a completely randomized dungeon made of awesome dice, complete with entrance and the exit down to the next level. Go forth and plunder!

#### The Dungeonmorph Cards Method

Using just the tiles, you want to build a shuffled stack first of as many as you have, preferably in dry-erase sleeves. Draw one, and that's the first node of the dungeon. Roll 1d8 to determine the entrance, and close off the second entrance on that side. Then roll 1d6 to determine how many of the entrances on the other three sides also lead off somewhere. Use a marker to "seal" the rest off.

When the party Explores to a new area, draw another tile. Roll 1d4 to determine which of the new tile's sides connect, then place it down. Roll 1d6 again to determine how many of the other three sides' exits lead off to new places, and again use a marker to seal the rest off.

For each room visited after the starting room, there is a *cumulative* 1 in 20 chance that one of the exits of the room leads down to the next dungeon level. For the sake of at least *some* kind of consistency in all this insanity, I recommend only having one such lead-down per level. However, if you prefer truly organic creation and are down with more, just reset this count each time one is discovered.

If you somehow happen to "close off" the dungeon using the above methods, without rolling a level exit, either A) add a level exit organically to the last-placed node tile, or B) just accept it as a single-level dungeon and call it good. Not every dungeon needs to be a multi-level descent into the depths of Demon Heck!

### Build the Divining Pool

Next, it's time to roll the Divining Pool! This dice pool is built using a mix of regular gaming dice plus the fancy colored dice from WFRP3. **First we build the initial Divining Pool.** This consists of two or more Warhammer funky dice, and possibly additional standard dice based on your game system of choice and any other third-party random tables you're incorporating.

Start with:

* **Standard Blue Die:** Always Start with one Blue WFRP3 Die.
* **Challenge Level:** This is up to the players, chosen at the beginning of the dungeon! Add 1, 2, or 3 Purple WFRP3 dice.

Add any of the following based on in-game actions and context:

* **Did they stealthily enter the room?** Add a Green Die.
* **Did they kick in the door and rush the room?** Add a Red Die.
* **Did anyone actually say "Huzzah!" when entering?** Add another Red Die.
* **Did they raise an alarm or otherwise fore-warn the room's occupants somehow?** Add a Black Die.
* **Are they taking any clever precautions or plans (other than the usual trap-checking)?** Add a White Die for each "really good idea" they have.
* **Do they have any useful tools that might affect the situation?** Add a Yellow Die if they are making active use of special gear, such as maps, potions, etc.
* **Other Mods:** Add more dice based on whim, nefarious plans, the "Scout Ahead" camp action results, cocky player complacency, shifting planes, stock market trends, and whatever else you feel makes sense.

Finally, depending on your game system, you may add other dice as well, such as:

* **d20:** To determine the Encounter Type in Dark Dungeons (pages 219-139)
* **Any other Dice:** If you have any other random check tables, add their dice to the pool, and roll them all at once to save time.

### Roll the Dice

With the Divining Pool complete, it's time to roll! **I highly suggest using a dice tray for this.**

The special symbols on the WFRP3 divining dice translate to different aspects of both the transition and the next room beyond. These pips create a pool that can be used to more or less purchase different effects to apply to the journey forward. As DM, you pick and choose which outcomes to apply, based on the feel and beat of the current flow of the game. The results are determined as follows:

#### **Comets and Chaos Stars: Extreme Outcomes!**

**Note:** Comets and Chaos Stars *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

These represent extreme boons or dangers in the destination room/node of the dungeon. For each **Comet** rolled in the pool, add +3 Hammers to the results! For each Chaos Star, add +3 Crossblades!

Take note of and possibly apply effects from applicable Comets and Chaos Stars before moving on to...

#### **Blood Drops and Hour Glasses: Loss of Resources**

**Note:** Blood Drops and Hour Glasses *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Blood Drops:** INJURY! When blood drops are rolled (Red dice only), the team suffered damage or stress of some kind in their charge forward. Roll Xd4 damage (X = current dungeon level) and have the team apply it among themselves.

**Hourglasses:** DELAY! When an Hourglass is rolled (Green dice only), the team suffered some form of additional delay getting to the next room. Knock off an additional 1d4 Turns of game time.

Apply all effects from Blood Drops and Hourglasses before moving on to...

#### **Falcons and Skulls: Encounters in Transit**

**Note:** These cancel each other out one for one, and only the *net* total remaining are counted.

Falcons give the party temporary boons, while Skulls give them setbacks. Setbacks tend to be a bit worse than boons, though, but that's just how adventuring works.

Net *Falcons* represent minor boons encountered during travel to the next room. For each net Falcon, apply a boon similar to the items on the list below. These are somewhat free-form, use whatever makes sense:

* The explore action did not cost them any time or light.
* They find the hidden pack of a long lost adventurer and re-up some supplies.
* The party receives a bonus re-roll that can be used to re-roll any single die in the next room only.
* blah

Net *Skulls* represent minor setbacks incurred during travel to the next room. Similar to Falcons, apply from the list below:

* Their active light sources flicker and sputter for whatever reason, removing an extra 1d4 turns of time from their durations.
* One of their maintained spells suddenly fails.
* Another random encounter happened by while in transit!
* One of their rations spoils and must be discarded!
* blah

Apply all effects from net Falcons or Skulls before moving on to...

#### **Hammers and Crossblades: Encounters at the Destination**

**Note:** Hammers and Crossblades *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Hammers:** Hammers represent greater boons and windfalls discovered in the *next room* of the dungeon. For each *total* Hammer in the pool, the next room/node contains a boon such as those on the list below. Each can be selected multiple times, even combined:

* The room contains a(n additional) random friendly encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward friendly.
* Decrease the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The party catches the room's encounter(s) by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Party.
* The room will function as a Safe Haven once cleared of encounters.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Magical.
* ...or any from the Falcons list above.

**Crossblades:** Crossblades represent sources of danger encountered in the *next room* of the dungeon. Similar to Hammers, options for Crossblades include:

* The room contains a(n additional) random hostile encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward hostile.
* Increase the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The occupants of the room catch the party by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Enemies.
* The room contains a dangerous trap that may or may not be concealed.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Cursed.
* ...or any from the Skulls list above.

**Hammer-Plus:** (Yellow die only) Some yellow results show a hammer with a plus. That means to first count the Hmmer toward the total, and then add *another* yellow die and immediately roll it, adding its results to the pool as well.

### Random Traps

To randomly add traps, I'm using the handy set of generators at the donjon. And if all else fails, there is the 1d20 Tricks and Traps table from the AD&D 1E DMG. To speed this up, I've added a handy traps table a bit further up.

I personally like to pre-roll about 50 traps for each potential dungeon level and then print out the list in advance, just in case I lack an internet connection at my game. Then when a new one is encountered, I start at the top of the list, use the next one, and cross it off when done.

### Random Monsters

With my current process, I use the Wandering Monsters table from p.129-130 of [Dark Dungeons][]. A single Crossblade means it has basic wandering numbers, two means it has an extra die, and three plus means it is a full-on lair of said creature, when applicable. A bit of common sense is required for working those out on the fly, of course, on a monster by monster basis.

### Random Treasure

For Random Encounter Treasure, I'm using a Windows program I found ages ago called [BECMI Utilities][]. It generates treasure based on the old Rules Cyclopedia "A-O, P-V" treasure classes, which Dark Dungeons also uses. I've made heavy use of these very tables in my own long-running weekend games, and am quite familiar with their typical yields.

Conversely, the [Donjon][] has the same treasure tool available there for AD&D/OSRIC editions (but not B/X and its ilk), if you are running with an internet connection.


### Describe the Exploration

Since this is a role-playing game, the description of what follows is pretty crucial. Use the contents of your map and the results of the Divining Roll to inform the description that you then give to the players.

When describing the new node's environs, do so with a hefty helping of vagueness. Give basic descriptions without exact measurements. Describe things "in passing" or otherwise cursory descriptions. If they want extended details and more specific measurements, they need to spend more time searching!


### Apply the Mechanics of Exploration

Exploration has a few resource mechanics applied to it as well. When you've finished describing the new locale, before handling any encounters, resolve the following:

**Time:** Exploration always takes at least 1 turn of time, possibly more with bad Divining Pool results. Mark off a minimum of 1 turn from all light sources and other ongoing time-tracked effects.


### Handle Any Encounters

After Rolling the pool, Describing the exploration, and then Applying the basic mechanics, it's time to resolve any Encounters that may have been rolled!


## Exploration Considerations

### Backtracking

Each time the party moves back through a room they've already visited, there is a cumulative 1 in 10 chance that the room has repopulated with enemies and stuff. If that chance occurs, roll a new encounter as normal. Nowhere is truly safe!

### Time-Keeping

This system of gaming requires a strict enforcement of timekeeping in the nature of "turns" of dungeon action. In accordance with classic rules:

* One Round = Ten Seconds of in-game time
* One Turn = Ten Minutes of in-game time (or Sixty Rounds of action time)
* One Hour = 6 Turns (or 360 Rounds)

This is crucial for keeping track of light sources and special short-duration game effects. Some basic notes of importance for the B/X and related rules sets that we use:

* A **Torch** lasts for 1 Hour (6 Turns)
* A **Lantern** lasts for 4 Hours (24 turns) on 1 flask of oil
* **Light spells** last for 6 turns, +1 per caster level
* Each **Explore Action** costs a turn as well. This does not locate any secrets, but does give a full visual description of the room they are entering.
* Each **Combat encounter** lasts a minimum of 1 turn, *regardless* of actual number of rounds. Combats longer than 60 rounds can last more than 1 turn - divide the total number of rounds by 60, rounding up, minimum of 1. That's how many turns it takes.
* **Searching for Secrets** takes one turn per 10 x 10 area of the node, and uses the Search skill. Characters can split up to search different places simultaneously and save time. For thieves, this will also include searching for traps.

# Final Notes

## Beyond the Dungeon

I've recently been thinking of how I can extend this system to build out a world beyond the individual dungeons themselves. There are a number of resources I've found online, including random hex-builders and more. If I get more feedback and take this process further, I'll add more notes and collections for beyond-the-dungeon randomization here as well.
