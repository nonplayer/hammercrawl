HAMMERCRAWL! System Appendix: The Nightmares Underneath

A document for using the HAMMERCRAWL! method with the game _The Nightmares Underneath_, by Johnstone Meztger.

One of the main goals of the process is to play older games while reducing book-checking. To that end, I've instituted a number of house rules to simplify play for fun and speed. Think of these as my system-specific House Rules for use when Hammercrawling.
