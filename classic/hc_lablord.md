HAMMERCRAWL! System Appendix: Labyrinth Lord

A document for using the HAMMERCRAWL! method with the game _Labyrinth Lord_, from Goblinoid Games.

One of the main goals of the process is to play older games while reducing book-checking. To that end, I've instituted a number of house rules to simplify play for fun and speed. Think of these as my system-specific House Rules for use when Hammercrawling.
