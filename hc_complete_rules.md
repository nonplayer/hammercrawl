# Welcome to the Meat Grinder

*Ahhhhh... Fresh Meat!*


## About this Document

This document is the beginning of my attempt to write a full HAMMERCRAWL! game system from the ground up. This is very much a work in progress.


### Future Plans

The intended result will hopefully be a recognizable game with inspirations from *Dark Dungeons*, *The Nightmares Underneath*, and *Dungeon Crawl Classics*.


### Acknowledgements

HAMMERCRAWL! in this "complete game" format would not exist without the amazing creativity contained in the followed pre-existing games:

* [Dark Dungeons](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177410/Dark-Dungeons) by Blacky the Blackball
* [Dungeon Crawl Classics](http://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/) by Goodman Games
* [The Nightmares Underneath](https://redboxvancouver.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/the-nightmares-underneath-rpg/) by Red Box Vancouver

Seriously, you should probably just go play those instead, they're much better games with much better production values.


### Cost, License, and Contributions

HAMMERCRAWL! is now and always will be a free game. Very few (if any) of these concepts are original to me, and asking for money for the project would just be wrong.

Contributions to testing and development are always welcome.


# About HAMMERCRAWL!

HAMMERCRAWL! is a fantasy dungeon-crawling role-playing game entirely derived from a half-dozen other similar games which were themselves built up from house rules for the older variants of "That One Game" (henceforth just referred to as The OG) that everyone knows. HAMMERCRAWL! doesn't try to do anything new or revolutionary, instead focusing on establishing a familiar-feeling baseline for 100% procedurally-generated tournament-style role-playing. It sands down a lot of the rough points, standardizes a number of odd inconsistencies, and sacrifices more than one established sacred idol of The OG in order to make the game a bit more approachable by noobs and randos that may plop down to play at a public tourney.

This text won't try to introduce you to the hobby or explain the ideas of role-playing to a novice reader of the genre. If this is your first introduction to a game text, good god, Lemon, I hope you enjoy reading but a lot of the text may be confusing. Good luck, and god speed.


## The Basics of Play

HAMMERCRAWL! is an old-school dungeon crawl based game. One of you will take on the role of the Hammersmith (aka Dungeon Master, Game Master, Judge, or whatever you like), and guide the proceedings. The rest of you will take on the roles of Players, and in turn guide Adventurers through a deathtrap meat-grinder of a dungeon that the Hammersmith describes for you.

**Player Roles and Expectations:**

* Role-play the character you have created (or drawn).
* Create Story by describing your Adventurer's actions, motivations, successes, and failures.
* Go into the Dungeons described by the Hammersmith
* Lead your Adventurer forth to Get Rich or Die Trying

**Hammersmith Roles and Expectations:**

* Arrange and master tools for spontaneous creation of play.
* Improvise description of the world around the Adventurers, and the actions it takes against and in response to them.
* Create Story by describing the dungeon environments that the Adventurers explore, and the perils and treasures that they encounter within.
* Enhance the world with Non-Player Characters and other interesting denizens.

Both the Hammersmith and the Players will work together to feed a group of Adventurers to a dungeon, and see who survives. Inside the dungeon, the heroes will encounter wicked monsters, insidious traps, maddening mazes, and hopefully gobs of amazing treasures. Those that fight bravely and/or wisely may just have what it takes to make it out of the dungeon, return to town, and level up to greater tiers of personal power and glory.


## The Tenets of HAMMERCRAWL!

**Tenet the First: Embrace Death** - You will die, frequently, and in hilarious ways. It's expected. Embrace it. There's no need to learn to "play better" and no need to "git gud" in this game. It's *meant* to be a brutally hilarious meat grinder. Enjoy the process of character divining, and even more so the churn of characters that replace your first ones, all of which will inevitably die memorably in the darkest of dungeons. And when they die, draw tombstones on the back of their sheets and give them amazing epitaphs, too!

**Tenet the Second: Don't Take it Seriously** - Have fun, and don't get too attached to your characters. Develop awesome stories and personalities for them, but do it all for a laugh. Develop their wants and dreams and then relish when those hopes are destroyed forever by the spiked maul of a demonic bugbear. Ham it up as much as you can, and generally have a good time with it all.


## Established Systemic Conventions

If you're familiar with The OG and its many derivatives, the following should probably make sense to you. HAMMERCRAWL! is built with the following system assumptions:

* **Roll High:** The system is tooled around all D20 rolls being targeted high. 20 is good, 1 is bad.
* **Stat Rolls:** Class is determined first, then 3D6 stats in order, with highest two determined by the class.
* **Race as Class:** Races are implemented as entirely separate character classes.
* **Skills:** In addition to expectations based on class abilities and career backgrounds, every character gets 4 random skills they are somehow good at as well.
* **Feats:** There are no "Feats" in this game, at least as codified by other derivatives of The OG.
* **Armor Class:** Base 10, Ascending.
* **Combat Initiative:** Side-based, then ordered by a five-step flow based on type of action (Move, Missile, Melee, Misc, Magic)
* **Damage:** Weapon damage is based on the Hit Die of the character using the weapon.
* **Experience Levels:** 15 levels for all characters. To attain the next Experience Level, you need that level x10 in Experience Points (XP), and every time you gain a level your XP reserve resets to zero.
* **Experience Points (XP):** XP is gained from exploring new locations and defeating the challenges within.
* **Advantages and Disadvantages:** They're in here, and they're incremental.
* **Consolidated Spellcasting:** Clerics and Magic-Users have much closer-aligned rules for spellcasting and memorization. This is to assist new/random drop-in players in having fun with playing these two classes, which have historically presented challenges for noobs.


## Materials of Play

A game of HAMMERCRAWL! requires the following materials of play.

### The Basics

* The game rules
* Multiple sets of gaming dice, including: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and at least one d30.
* Various writing utensils
* The spells and monsters from at least one other "classic" game (I tend to use *Dark Dungeons*, but YMMV).


### The Randomizers

This method focuses entirely on spontaneous, random play, and as such you're going to need a buttload of Random Generator tools. A good number of these are linked in [the base Readme file](./README.md) as well as at the end of this document in Appendix R.


### The Divining Dice

The 'Smith needs a set of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition dice to serve as a way to "divine" the results of the party's actions. I am currently looking into adapting this system to use the new Genesys Fantasy RPG Dice, as well.

To quickly run through the dice, with WFRP3 you get a mix of seven different types of dice, coded by color: Blue, Yellow, White, Green, Red, Black, and Purple. Each of these colors represents a different purpose, such as Challenge, Luck, Fortune, Skull, and so on. Their different faces have symbols instead of numerical pips, which you can use to divine the outcomes of tests in that game. For this game, the dice translate as:

* **Blue: The Reward Die** - rolled to find new fortunes and treasure.
* **Red: The "Huzzah!" Die** - rolled when the heroes are especially brave and/or foolhardy.
* **Green: The Caution Die** - rolled to reward careful strategy and conversation.
* **White: The Luck Die** - added to the pool for good ideas and plans.
* **Black: The Dark Die** - added when the players' own actions turn against them.
* **Yellow: The Die of Expertise** - representing solid applied skill and craft.
* **Purple: The Die of Challenge** - Purple dice can bring great danger and peril, but amplify XP!

Don't have dice of your own? [Use the Broken Tome generator](http://brokentome.com/tools/DiceRoller.aspx)! There are a number of other apps available as well:

* Android: [WFRP Dice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.WFRPDice&hl=en_US)

# Book One: The Player's Guide to Crawling Dungeons


## CHAPTER: Creating Your Character

You will need the following for this process:

* A printed character sheet or other such notepad
* A writing utensil
* A full set of gaming dice


##### Sidebar: The Online Generation Method

I strongly recommend using [my companion random character generator program](https://github.com/nonplayer/OldSchoolCharGen) for this process. It allows entire stacks of characters to be generated with a few keystrokes. Hammersmiths can thus create a single pile of replacement characters for instant access and insertion into an ongoing dungeon, saving time in longer play sessions with high death tolls.


### Step 1: Roll Your Class

First and foremost, you must randomly determine your new character's Class. Roll 3d6, and then consult the following table:

| Roll  | Class             |
|-------|-------------------|
| 3-4   | Elf Exemplar      |
| 5-7   | Dwarf Defender    |
| 8-13  | Human*            |
| 14-16 | Halfling Burglar  |
| 17-18 | Half-ogre Berserker |

\*If human, roll 1d4 to determine your actual class:

1. Cleric
2. Fighter
3. Magic-User
4. Thief

**Note:** These tables are for a primarily humanocentric fantasy setting, such as that established in The OG. Adjust these as needed for your campaign setting.


### Step 2: Record your Class Data

Each class has its own special rules and abilities. Take note of yours using the references below.


#### Dwarf Defender

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 25
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Luck, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Area = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour except longbows.
* **Bonus Languages:** Dwarf

**Born in Armor:** Dwarves in Medium or heavier armour do not suffer AC penalties from low DEX mods. Heavy armour never reduces their movement speed.

**Born of Earth and Stone:** Dwarves are never lost when underground with solid earth or stone beneath their feet. They know the local grades and depth, and can feel air flow naturally. They have a 50% chance of detecting hidden stonework just by passing, and automatically find it if they spend a turn searching.

**Dwarf Battlemaster:** Dwarves have a bonus melee-only attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, a Dwarf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Dwarven Resilience:** Dwarves have advantage on all of their Good saves.

**Shield Brothers:** Dwarves can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice. Additionally, dwarves do not lose the AC bonus of their shield when using the bash.


#### Elf Exemplar

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Mind, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Body, Area, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour. Armour may limit spellcasting.
* **Bonus Languages:** Elf

**Ageless Perfection:** Elves are immune to sleep, charm, slow, haste, aging, and energy drain effects, *unless* those effects are results of the magic of an Elf (self or other, alive or undead).

**Ancient Arcanists (Spellcaster):** Elves can cast spells from the magic-user list. Elves begin the game with a spellbook containing *Read Magic*. Additionally the book contains a base of one (1) randomly-determined bonus spell. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Elf's INT mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Elf adds one (1) new spell to their book from their own ongoing experimentation, and they can add more by transcribing scrolls and magical texts found in dungeons. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Elf can only cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience.

**Armoured Spellcaster:** Elves are better at casting in armour than humans. Elves suffer no chance of spell failure in Light armour, and a 25%/50%/75% chance when wearing medium/heavy/plate armours, respectively. Failed spells are forgotten per normal rules.

**Blade Dancer:** Elves are skilled at fighting with two weapons at once. When wielding two one-handed weapons, Elves roll one extra attack die, but lower their damage die by one step (to a d6) for the entire assault. At level 9, this increases to two extra attack dice.

**Keen Awareness:** Elves are spatially aware of their surroundings at all time. They have a 50% chance of noticing concealed *non-stonework* doors and panels simply by passing near them, and automatically find them if they spend a turn searching.

**War Adept:** Elves have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, an Elf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.


#### Halfling Burglar

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, CHA
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 20
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Area, Body, Death, Luck, Mind, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** None
  - **Bad:** None
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all small weapons one-handed, or medium two-handed. Cannot use two-handed human-sized weapons. Can use shields.
* **Bonus Languages:** Halfling

**Backup Fighter:** Halflings can function as fighters of a sort, when needed. Halflings gain a bonus attack die at levels 4, 8, and 12. When attacking, a Halfling declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Backup Thief:** Halflings can also function as thieves of a sort, in a pinch. They have the following Thief Skills: Lockpicking (DEX), Perception (WIS), Stealth (DEX, with Advantage), Thief-Climbing (STR), and Trap-Finding (INT, with Disadvantage). Additionally, at level one the Halfling adds +1 to any two of these Skills. Each additional level they add two more points to their skills as they see fit. They cannot invest more points in any single skill than their current level.

**Often Overlooked:** Unless their actions indicate them to be an obvious threat, or their opponents are otherwise specifically predisposed against them, a halfling is always attacked last.

**Sudden Inner Strength:** A Halfling can draw from their inner strength for a sudden display of unexpected fierceness. By spending 1 Hit Point before they roll their attacks, they can increase the damage die size for their attacks this round by one step.

**Tactical Attacker:** Halflings roll with advantage on Tactical Attacks.

**Wee:** Halfling size limits a few of their combat options. They cannot use polearms, long bows, heavy crossbows, or any other weapons that require two hands for humans.


#### Half-ogre Berserker

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Area, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons and shields. Armour must be custom made.
* **Bonus Languages:** Ogre

**Chaotic Nature:** Berserkers cannot be aligned to Law.

**Large and in the Way:** Half-ogres stand around 7 feet tall or more, and are built like icehouses. All armour must be custom made for them at increased costs and time, and only Halfling-sized creatures or smaller can move through their occupied space if minis and a battlemat are in use.

**Murderous Rage:** Berserker blood is instilled with traces of the same dark rage that drives their ogrish ancestors to war against the kingdoms of humans. When a Berserker takes damage, they must make a Mind save (target: 12) or go into an uncontrollable violent fury. During this rage, they have advantage on melee and thrown damage dice rolls, immunity to critical fumbles, and disadvantage on all saves except Body and Death. On their turn, they must take action according to the following priority chain - higher-listed actions are mandatory if possible:

* Melee Attack the strongest-looking enemy within immediate striking range.
* Move to the strongest-looking enemy within charging range and Melee Attack them.
* Thrown (Missile) attach the strongest-looking enemy within Thrown Range.
* Melee Attack the strongest-looking *standing* living creature (friend or foe) within immediate striking range (Mind Save DC 12 each time to avoid attacking an ally).
* Mind Save (target: 15) to break out of rage: if successful you mind clears and you spend the round panting, if failed you Collapse to the ground unconscious (remain unconscious for 3d6 minutes)

A Berserker can choose to voluntarily fail either save and willingly let the rage overtake them and/or knock them unconscious afterward. They can also trigger it on their own by causing themselves 1 point of damage with a weapon.

**Savage Warrior:** Berserkers have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, a Berserker declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Two-Hander:** When using a two-handed melee weapon, Berserkers roll d12 damage dice with their attacks (instead of d10), applying the result to all attacks that hit.


#### Human Cleric

* **Prime Stats:** WIS, CHA
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Luck, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Mind, Body, Death = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Area = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour that are not otherwise prohibited by their deity.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Aligned to the Gods:** Clerics must believe in a great deific cause, and as such cannot be of Neutral alignment.

**Heavenly Power (Spellcaster):** Clerics channel the divine will of their deities to cast spells from the Cleric spell list. Clerics begin the game with a holy prayerbook which contains a base of two (2) randomly-determined clerical prayers. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Cleric's WIS mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Cleric is divinely inspired to add two (2) new prayers to their book, and they can add more by sanctifying, converting, and transcribing prayers to other gods found on scrolls and books in dungeons. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Cleric can only cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience.

**Turn Away the Unholy** Once per Day per Level of Experience, a Cleric can hold aloft the symbol of their righteous faith and turn back undead, devils, demons, and any others that the Hammersmith deems to be enemies of their faith. All such opponents must make Mind saves based on the difference in Level/HD Tiers. Targets who fail this save must cower, flee, or possibly even take damage or be destroyed.


#### Human Fighter

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Area = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Fighters can use all weapons, shields, and armour.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Combat Superiority:** Fighters have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. When attacking, a Fighter declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Not Today!:** At first level and each level after, the Fighter gains a single use of "Not Today!" When a Fighter would take damage (from any source) that would reduce their Hit Points from positive to Zero or below, they can spend a use and instead remain at 1 HP and negate the rest of the damage from that attack. These uses accumulate with each level, but each use is permanently lost upon spending.

**Primary Tank:** Fighters have advantage on all Hit Dice rolls, *and* reroll all 1s on Hit Dice.

**Shield-Trained:** Fighters can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice. After a bash, the Fighter loses the shield's AC bonus until the start of their next turn in combat.

**Two-Hander:** When using a two-handed weapon, Fighters roll an *extra* damage die with their attacks, applying the result to all attacks that hit.


#### Human Magic-User

* **Prime Stats:** INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d4 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** D: You have no level-based combat bonus to attacks.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Mind = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Luck = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Body, Area, Death, Rally = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can not use two-handed weapons except staves. Can not wear heavy armour or use shields. Other armour can cause spell failure.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Armour-Inept:** Magic-users cannot wear Heavy armour, and suffer a chance of spell failure while wearing other armour. In Light armour, the chance is 50%, and in Medium armour the chance is 75%. Failed spells are forgotten per normal rules.

**Bloodcaster:** Magic-users can choose to take damage instead of forgetting spells. The amount of HP damage taken is equal to the level of spell just cast. If below Zero HP, this burns CON instead.

**Highcaster:** Magic-users (only) can prepare and even attempt to cast spells of higher level than they normally would be able to, provided they have a copy of the spell in their book. Casting the spell requires permanent loss of INT score equal to the difference in allowed spell levels. Such INT loss can only be regained through the use of the Cleric's *Restoration* spell. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

**Magical Mind:** Magic-users can cast the spell *Read Magic* freely and at will, without need to prepare, memorize, or roll.

**Wizardly Ways (Spellcaster):** Magic-users are best known for their ability to cast spells from the Magic-User spell list. Magic-Users begin the game with a spellbook containing *Read Magic*. Additionally the book contains a base of two (2) randomly-determined bonus spells. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Magic-User's INT mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Magic-user adds two (2) new spells to their book from their own ongoing experimentation, and they can add more by transcribing scrolls and magical texts found in dungeons. Spells are cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Magic-User can safely cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience. Take note of their Highcast ability, above.

**Wizardly Weaponry:** Magic-users can make use of new special mage-only weapons: The Wand and The Staff. Be warned that actively using these tools will mark you as a magician, and likely increase your chances of becoming a target priority by smart enemies...


#### Human Thief

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** C: You add 1/3 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Area, Luck = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Death, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Body = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Thieves can use any weapons and armour that the Hammersmith deems to be suitably sneaky.
* **Bonus Languages:** Thieves' Cant

**Stabbity!:** When a Thief is using a melee weapon to attack a foe against which the Thief either has attack advantage or is hidden from perception, the thief doubles their damage against that foe on a successful hit. This multiple increases by +1 at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.

**Thief Skills:** Thieves have access to a special array of professional skills which can allow them special unique methods to assess and even bypass dangers. These are: Deciphering (INT), Lockpicking (DEX), Perception (WIS), Stealth (DEX), Thief-climbing (STR), Tracking (WIS), Trap-finding (INT), and Trap-breaking (DEX). At first level the Thief must randomly determine one Thief Skill to be their Bailiwick, and one to be their Failing. The thief gets advantage on checks related to their Bailiwick, and disadvantage on checks related to their Failing.

**Thiefy Expertise:** Once per adventure per experience level, the Thief can attempt to reroll a failed Thief Skill check. This count resets upon Returning to Town.

**Tactical Attacker:** Thieves roll with advantage on Tactical Attacks.

**Trapwise:** Thieves have advantage on all Saves against the effects of Traps.


### Step 3: Choose Your Alignment

Choose from the following five: Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, and Neutral.


### Step 4: Roll Your Stats

Now roll 3d6 six times, and write them down in order.

*Example: Darla rolls 3d6 six times and writes them down in the order she rolled them: 9, 14, 11, 10, 5, and 17.*

**First** assign your highest rolls *in order of their rolling* to the Prime Stats of your character class. Most classes should have two Prime Stats, some only one, and maybe others three. However many, take the highest rolls from your set in the order they were rolled, and assign them to the Prime Stats in the order they appear on the character sheet.

*Example: Since Darla rolled a Fighter in the first step, she notes that her class's Prime Stats are STR and CON. Darla's highest-rolled stats are 14 and 17. Assigning them in the order rolled, she notes that her new Fighter now has a STR of 14 and a CON of 17.*

**Next** assign the remaining rolls *in order of their rolling* to the remaining empty stats on your character sheet.

*Example: Darla's remaining rolls are 9, 11, 10, and 5. She assigns them in order to her Fighter's remaining stats, which results in a final spread of: STR 14, DEX 9, CON 17, INT 11, WIS 10, CHA 5.*

**Finally** record the stat mods next to each one, using the following table:

| Stat  | Mod |
|-------|-----|
| 3     | -3  |
| 4-5   | -2  |
| 6-8   | -1  |
| 9-12  | 0   |
| 13-15 | +1  |
| 16-17 | +2  |
| 18    | +3  |

Stats are explained in further detail immediately below.


#### Basics of Stats

There are six core stats: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). Each stat has a Base Score and a Derived Modifier. The **Base Score** is determined by the initial 3D6 roll. These initial scores are not used much outside of their initial purpose of determining the Stats' derived modifiers. The **Modifier** is a number from -3 to +3, determined by the table above. This number is most commonly used to modify a character's relevant active dice rolls when attempting actions during play.

Each of the six core stats affects certain mechanics, as detailed below:


##### Strength (STR)


**Modifies:**

* Melee Attack Rolls
* Melee Damage Rolls
* Thrown Damage Rolls


##### Dexterity (DEX)

**Modifies:**

* Area Save Rolls
* Armour Class
* Initiative Rolls
* Missile Attack Rolls


##### Constitution (CON)

**Modifies:**

* Body Saves
* Hit Die Rolls


##### Intelligence (INT)

**Modifies:**

* Elf and Magic-User Starting Spells
* Starting Languages
* Starting Skills


##### Wisdom (WIS)

**Modifies:**

* Cleric Starting Spells
* Initiative
* Mind Saves


##### Charisma (CHA)

**Modifies:**

* Rally Saves
* Reaction Rolls


### Step X: Roll Your Skills

While your character is assumed to have many unwritten skills simply through their class and background, you also begin the game with a few randomly determined skills that you somehow picked up during your pre-game life. Explanations for how you learned these skills are up to you.

At creation, you begin with a base of 4 skills, modified by your INT mod. Thus if you have a -2 INT mod, then you only start with two skills. These are all you get. You will not automatically acquire more skills unless the Hammersmith and/or the whims of the game otherwise gift them to you.

If you're using the character generator python tool, this is already handled for you!

If not, this section is pending until I get the lists converted from that code...

### Step X: Confirm and Note Important Sub-Stats

* Experience Level (1) and associated Character Tier (1)
* Hit Points = Your Maximum Hit Die, plus your Con Mod, minimum of 1.
* Armor Class (AC) = 10 + DEX mod + AC mod from any Armour and Shields
* Melee Attack Modifier = STR mod + any class mods
* Melee Damage Modifier = STR mod
* Missile Attack Modifier = DEX mod + any class mods
* Movement Speed = determined by class (human base is 30)


#### Step X: Randomize Your Character Traits

TBD (see generator program for now)


#### Step X: Generate Your Starting Equipment

TBD (see generator program for now)


### Step X: Name Your Characters

Now it's time to give the character a name. Thing is, *you* don't get to give it that name. Instead, pass your character sheet to the player (*not* the Smith) sitting to your left. *They* get to name your character, and they are encouraged to Go Wild.


### Step X: Determine Party (Player) Roles

Hopefully the rest of your group has been making your characters alongside one another, and you've now all reached this point together. It's time to determine the party roles, which are mainly for administration and also for the use of the special new Party Actions.

**The Roles to Assign:**

* **Party Leader:** This player is responsible for informing the Hammersmith when the party moves on or takes any of the Party Actions.
* **Mapper:** This player is responsible for translating the Hammersmith's descriptions to a map that the party can use, in whatever artistic fashion the player sees fit.
* **Lootkeeper:** This player keeps a master list of all the loot discovered, so it can be fairly distributed by the party upon returning to town. It might not be wise to assign this role to the Thief...
* **Timekeeper:** The player tracks the passage of game Turns, and keeps track of who is carrying what light sources (and how much time is left on them).


### Final Step: Take it All In

Take a moment to think about the kind of person your character is. Think about their goals, their ambitions, their reasons for doing the things they do. And while you're at it, take a long hard moment to ponder exactly what kind of person they have to be in order to willingly leave everything behind and delve into terrifying and disgusting dungeons.


## CHAPTER: Playing Your Character

As a reference for Play, this section is sorted alphabetically by subject.


### Advancement (ref)

See "Experience"


### Attack Ranks

Every character class has an associated Attack Rank, which determines their base combat attack bonuses.

| Rank | Bonus                                                  |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| A    | You add your level to your attack rolls.               |
| B    | You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls. |
| C    | You add 1/3 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls. |
| D    | You have no level-based combat bonus to attacks.       |


### Camping (ref)

See "Party Actions"


### Character Tiers (ref)

See "Experience"


### Combat (ref)

Given the depth involved in a combat encounter, the fighting mechanics have their own separate chapter. See "Combat and Fighting" further below.


### Damage

Your base damage with all weapons is equal to your Class Hit Die. Some weapons may have special modifiers to this, however.

Dwarves, Half-ogres, and Fighters have special damage rules with Two-Handed weapons (see classes for details).


#### Zero Hit Points

When your adventurer is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you're not dead... *not yet*. First, any damage taken in excess of what would be needed to drop you to Zero hit points is immediately taken out of your CON score. This loss is *permanent* until magically restored (see below). Now if *that* reduces you to 0 CON, *then* you're dead. See the "Death" section for how to proceed.

If you've still got CON score left after over, then you're still up! But you're now getting badly wounded, and each breath you take brings you one step closer to the doorway to the afterlife. On your turn, you can choose one of the following two options:

* Lay Down and Call for Help
* Fight On!

If you choose to **Lay Down**, you drop to the ground prone. On this round and every round following it until you are healed, you must make a Death save. If you fail, you take an immediate point of permanent CON loss. If this drops you to Zero, you're dead.

If you choose to **Fight On**, you can take an action as normal! Resolve it, and at the end of your action you immediately take 1d4 permanent CON damage, no save allowed. If this drops you to Zero, you're dead. Repeat for each turn that you continue to Fight on.

*In either case,* while your HP is zero, any further damage you may take from additional attacks or effects targeting you comes directly out of your CON score. Once your CON reaches Zero, you are Dead.


#### Magically Restoring Lost CON

If your CON has been permanently reduced due to taking damage below zero HP, then the only way to restore it is through advanced medical technology of 21st century or later (good luck finding that in your dirty-ass dungeon), or instead via a special alternate use of the Level 4 Cleric Spell *Cure Serious Wounds* spell (or similar potion or scroll).

When *Cure Serious Wounds* is used to restore lost CON from damage, ignore the spell's normal printed effect and use the following description instead:


##### Cure Serious Wounds

* **Target:** One living creature
* **Range:** Touch
* **Duration:** Permanent
* **Effect:** Restore 1d4 + Caster Level in lost CON stat points to the target. The caster can target themselves with this spell.


### Death

TBD


### Encounters (the Players' version)

Misc:

* basic encounter expectations
* reaction basics
* parley and such
* etc

Extended encounter rules in Hammersmith section.


### Experience

Experience is the currency of character advancement in HAMMERCRAWL! As characters go on adventures, defeat threats, and gather wealth, they will accrue experience points (XP) which can be cashed in to increase experience levels.

Experience in HAMMERCRAWL! is earned from the following two activities:

* Killing your Enemies
* Taking their Stuff

Okay, it's a *bit* more complicated than that, but not much. Read on below.


#### XP from Challenges

The primary method of XP acquisition is by exploring new locations and dungeon rooms, and then defeating the challenges within those rooms. When a challenge is defeated, each individual surviving member of the party earns an amount of XP based on the following factors:

* Exploring a new Room
* Defeating Challenges
* Dungeon Level Tier Modifiers

In HAMMERCRAWL!, XP is only gained *after* overcoming challenges generated from the Divining Pool. When the party survives a new rolled challenge, use the following process to determine the how *base* XP reward:

1. **Did they explore a new Room?** Each time the party discovers a new "room" or "node" in the dungeon (specifically after using the Explore Action), start the reward with a single XP. This is based on the "node" based method of dungeon exploration; if you're running a room-heavy dungeon, you may need to restrict this to once per "region" of rooms instead.
2. **Did they defeat the challenges?** If there was a challenge in the room, increase the reward by the total number of Crossblades rolled in that encounter's Divining Pool, plus any additional Hammers rolled. Note that Hammers only add to the XP reward pool if at least one Crossblade was also present - rewards without challenge earn no XP!
3. **Are they on a level-appropriate Dungeon Tier?** Multiply the reward based on comparing the party's average level Tier to that of the current dungeon level:


| Dungeon Level Tier is: | Reward Mod:            |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 or more lower        | One-Tenth (round down) |
| 1 lower                | One-Half (round down)  |
| Equal                  | No Mod                 |
| 1 higher               | Multiply x2            |
| 2 or more higher       | Multiply x10           |


**XP Rewards are Individual!** Once calculated, *each* surviving party member receives the same amount of XP. It is not divided among them, instead being given out equally in full. As such there is no inherent XP-driven benefit to sacrificing party members in the hopes of getting more XP.


**Modifying The XP Rewards:** The Hammersmith may choose to raise or lower the rewards after the fact based on group performance or unexpected results. If the party wins against overwhelming odds, for example, the 'Smith may decide to raise the comparative Tier of the enemies to account for an unusual smashing success. Conversely, if the party is just "grinding rats" in the noob zone for an XP mill, the 'Smith may decide to reward them no XP at all for their bad attitudes about the whole thing.


#### Ad-Hoc Experience Awards

Hammersmiths may feel like rewarding some players with spontaneous experience boons when those players come up with good ideas or engage in captivating scenes of role-playing. I recommend keeping these to a minimum, and instead making players earn those valuable XPs through the expected core methods, but hey, it's your game, go buck wild. Use the following as a guideline, based on the occurrence that you feel deserves the reward:

* Hah yeah, okay that was pretty cool: 1 XP
* Whoah, that was awesome!: 3 XP
* (table, players, and household all literally explode from the magnitude of sheer bodacious game fire): 5 XP


#### Experience and Money

Unlike some older "classic" games, characters do not gain XP from money in HAMMERCRAWL! Instead, they gain it by exploring new rooms and defeating the challenges within, based on the results of the Divining Pool.


#### Leveling Up

In order to attain the next level of ability in your Class, you must accrue an amount of XP equal to the next level times 10. You must then either use the Level Up camp action, or return to Town.

When you attain the next level, the following things happen, in order:

1. Your XP total resets to Zero. Any accrued XP over the amount needed to level up is erased.
2. Your level increases by 1, to a maximum of 15.
3. You gain an additional Hit Die based on your class.
4. Reroll ALL of your Hit Dice, and apply your CON Mod to the total. The total becomes your new maximum Hit Points. If the total is less than your previous HP total, your new HP total is instead equal to the previous amount +1.
5. Acquire any new abilities as specific by your Class.
6. Take note of any increases to your Saves.


### Healing (ref)

See "Damage"


### Hirelings and Henchmen

(work in progress)

**First off** every Hireling has an associated **Profession.** This states the scope of action they are skilled in.

Example Professions and associated abilities:

* Blah

Additionally, every Hireling has a base Tier, which determines everything else about their usefulness and cost.

**Hireling Tier Table:**

| Hireling Tier | Daily Cost | Expertise | Chance of Finding | Description                             |
|---------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0             | 1 Ration   | 0         | 100 in 100        | Unskilled                               |
| 1             | 1 cp       | 1         | 1 in 10           | Apprentice                              |
| 2             | 2 sp       | 2         | 1 in 20           | Expert                                  |
| 3             | 3 gp       | 3         | 1 in 100          | Master                                  |
| 4             | 4 pp       | 4         | 1 in 1,000        | Best in their Field for the Present Day |
| 5             | 5 XP!      | 5         | 1 in 10,000       | Best in their Field in all of History   |

**Tier:** The Tier is used for all associated and relevant mechanics. It determines the base bonus to related abilities, and the number of hit dice the hireling has should they come into question.

**Daily Cost:** Every hireling has a daily cost that must be paid in order to secure their continued service. Tier 0 hirelings merely require food and a place to sleep. At Tiers 1 and higher, their daily cost is equal to their tier matched with a step on the Money Chain (see the table). Yes, those tier 5 hirelings require you to give them XP instead of money!

**Expertise:** Every Hireling gets an Expertise bonus equal to their Tier applied to any checks related to their Professional abilities. Tier 0 hirelings don't get this bonus, but you probably knew that already - you didn't hire them to be good at anything but holding a torch and serving as dungeon "canaries."

**Chance of Finding:** Pretty self-explanatory. If you're looking for one, that's your chance of finding them.

**Description:** A general eyeballing of how that hireling fits into the hierarchy of ability for their chosen profession.


#### Finding a Hireling

Go to a place where you might expect a hireling to be found - that means a town or other social center that is most likely *not* in a dungeon. Ask around, chances are you will find someone interesting...


#### Putting Up With Your Bullshit (aka Morale)

Hirelings are subject to Morale, but it's handled a bit differently than it is for NPCs not in the PCs' employ. And for Hirelings, the scope covers not just being thrust into dangerous encounters, but also being asked to work beyond the limits of their contracts.

Hirelings prefer to keep their demanded work within the scope of the expertise they were hired for. When you push a hireling to act too often or intensely, or when a Hireling gets into danger far above its preferred safety level, the 'Smith may require you to make a Rally save in order to keep the hireling's current services. This is a check per normal Saves rules, using the difference between your relative Tiers to determine the target (making expensive higher-tier hirelings more difficult to hold onto after pissing them off!).

If you succeed at the save, you keep your hireling for the time being, without changes to your contract. If you fail the save by 5 or less, they may choose to remain, but require double the daily cost. If you fail by more than 5, they quit your service immediately, possibly becoming hostile.


### Leveling Up (ref)

See "Experience"


### Light and Darkness

As none of the base classes in HAMMERCRAWL! can see in the dark, having a source of light is crucial to successful dungeon delving. How can you expect to explore a dungeon and stay alive if you can't see?! In addition to all the standard role-playing needs that light serves in a game like this, the special meta-action of HAMMERCRAWL! are directly affected by it as well. For one you, absolutely require at least one light source in order to Camp, and if you try and Explore without light then you add potentially several additional dangerous Black Dice to the 'Smith's Divining Pool.

HAMMERCRAWL! uses "classic" light sources and turn durations:

* 1 torch = Burns for 6 turns (1 hour), with a 20-foot radius of effective light
* lantern w/ 1 flash of oil = burns for 24 turns (4 hours), with a 40-foot radius of effective light

When a character is acting under the effects of darkness, the following mechanics apply:

* Their Combat Attack Dice pool is reduced by one. If this reduces it to Zero, they cannot effectively attack.
* They can not perform Critical Hits on natural rolls of 20. Such rolls are treated as normal 20s instead, without the usual double damage effect.
* Their Damage Hit Die is treated as one die size lower than it would normally be.
* They roll with Disadvantage on Skill rolls and Area Saves.


### Magic (ref)

Given the depth of magical ways, the magic rules have their own separate chapter. See "Magic and Spellcasting" further below.


### Mapping

TBD


### Morale

The player characters themselves are as brave as their players choose them to be. Their allies and henchpersons, however, are usually decidedly less so. The same goes for many enemies that the adventurers beat on, who might come to the realization that cowering or even running away are better choices than fighting to the death against superior opponents.

When a NPC that *is not* under the leadership or employ of a player character faces a life-threatening situation, the 'Smith may require it to make a Morale check. This is done by rolling a standard Rally Save against a Target determined by comparing the NPC's HD Tier against the threat's HD Tier (see the "Saving Throws" section, below).

If no mechanical basis of comparison is immediately apparent, just eyeball the Target as follows:

* Minor Threat: 9
* Major Threat: 15
* OMGWTFBBQRUN: 21

If the NPC passes the Save, they grit their teeth and fight on! If they fail, they either freeze in panic, cower in their boots, wet themselves, and/or run screaming immediately (up to the 'Smith based on the feel of the moment).

NPCs that are under the leadership of a player character are called "Hirelings" and handle morale checks different. See the "Hirelings and Henchmen" section, above.


### Party Meta-Actions

The HAMMERCRAWL! rules add a set of special meta-actions to the mix, which the Party Leader can call upon to move the game forward. There are three of these:

* **Camp** lets the party recover some resources by taking an hour of rest.
* **Explore** moves the party to the next room or "node" of the dungeon.
* **Return to Town** sends the party out of the dungeon to their staging town, to spend loot and level up.


#### Party Action: Camp

The party Leader can choose to take a Camp Action at any location deemed a **Safe Haven**. These are discovered when the Hammersmith announces them as such, usually through the roll of net Falcons in the Divining Pool. This requires Light and Rations, however. The Party Leader can activate a Camp action at any time while in a Safe Haven, provided the party has the required resources below:

* **Time:** The action takes a minimum of 6 Turns (1 hour; light is required and spent accordingly unless the *entire* party can somehow see in the dark)
* **Food:** Each character must consume 1 Ration

First, each character in the party gets the following action for free:

* **Cleric, Magic-User:** Re-memorize 1 daily spell.
* **Dwarf, Fighter, Halfling, Half-ogre, and Thief:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs.
* **Elf:** Either re-memorize 1 daily spell *or* recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs.

Then, each player gets to pick one additional Camp Action to perform now:

* **Rest:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs (or the second half, if doubling up from the free action above). **Requires Food:** Choosing this action consumes one additional Ration.
* **Re-Memorize:** Recover one previously-spent daily spell use per character level.
* **Craft Ammo:** Add 2d4 normal arrows for your bow/crossbow, or collect as many stones for your sling.
* **Level up!:** If the hero has enough XP to reach the next level, they can apply the effects of that level as a Camp Action. Follow the core process for Leveling Up. Note that it does not heal existing HP loss or restore used spells or abilities (those are separate Camp Actions, above).
* **Stand Watch:** Add a Green Die to the next room explored, and -1 to Smith's camp encounter roll (below).
* **Scout Ahead:** Roll Search (or other system-appropriate check). If successful, add one Yellow die to next 1d4 new rooms explored. If failed, add Black dice instead.

Finally, **The Hammersmith Rolls 1d6:**

* Subtract 1 for each party member Standing Watch
* Add the current Dungeon Level

If total is 6+, an encounter happens while the party is camping! Roll as usual to generate a standard encounter, using the Divining Pool as if an Explore action had occurred. Apply any bonus color dice from camp actions to this roll. If none of the PCs chose to Stand Watch, then they are also surprised!

If an encounter occurs during camp, the Time and Rations are still spent, and all other chosen Camp Actions still occur. Resolve them before beginning the encounter's initiative checks.


#### Party Action: Explore

Each dungeon will likely consist of multiple levels, with many rooms among them. Each room can contain numerous horrible dangers, but also a good chance at wondrous loot as well. Moving from room to room requires exploration, which invites danger but also creates opportunity for new treasures and rewards!

In order to continue exploring the Dungeon, your party leader must tell the 'Smith' that your group is moving on to the next Room - be sure to discuss tactics and approaches before you move! Moving to the next room in this fashion initiates the **Explore Action** and tells the 'Smith' that it's time to roll the dungeon die and the Divining Pool. The rules for divining the Explore Action are in the Hammersmith's section of the rules.

**TIME:** The Explore action requires a minimum of 1 turn of time, so have light sources ready!


#### Party Action: Return to Town

When the heroes finally return to town (which likely involves first backtracking through the dungeon to their original exit), the following happens, in order:

1. Restore all HP totals to Max, and relearn daily Spells and Powers.
2. Restore their standard starting equipment list to full original capacity.
3. The party divides up their loot and plunder as they see fit.
4. Each player can choose to spend any amount of their loot to acquire better goods at the DM's allowance. This could take time, though, so you might want to skip it in Con and One-Shot games.
5. If anyone has enough XP to level up, they follow the Leveling Up process.
6. Role-play any town encounters or experiences you wish.
7. Return to the Dungeons!


### Reactions (ref)

See "Encounters"


### Saving Throws

You will frequently be asked to make a "saving throw" in order to resist affects from spells, traps, and many other dangers. The Hammersmith will tell you when you need to make a Save, and which of the following Six categories that save falls under:

* Area: Dodges and Large Area Effect Attacks
* Death: Insta-Kills and Bleeding Out
* Mind: Mental Debilitations
* Body: Physical Debilitations
* Luck: Fate and Fortune
* Rally: Leadership and Morale

When it's time to make the check, roll 1d20 and add your relevant modifier based on your class and stats. The target number for your roll is based on the "Tier" of power of the source effect, determined by comparing the source's relevant power tier to your character's current experience tier:

| Source Tier is…    | Target |
|--------------------|--------|
| Two or more Lower  | 9      |
| One Lower          | 12     |
| Equal              | 15     |
| One Higher         | 18     |
| Two or more Higher | 21     |

For example, a 2nd level Adventurer (Tier 1) saving against the magical fear effect of a 7th level Monster (Tier 3) would have to roll an 18 or higher, due to the differences in their tiers.


### Searching for Hidden Secrets

Adventurers can search for clues and hidden secrets in the dungeon by spending time in active investigation. A character can search a single 10 x 10 area in a minimum one Turn of time, and of course the party can split up to cover more ground in larger areas by searching simultaneously. Characters can spend longer searching, and increase their chances of success.

When one or more characters are searching, the Hammersmith asks how many characters (if any) are searching together, and how long they intend to spend searching. After the time stated, the 'Smith secretly rolls to see if they found anything that may have been hidden in their area. Each character searching has a cumulative 1 in 6 chance of finding a hidden secret in the area per turn spent searching. If they work together, their efforts are combined. For example, two characters who spend two turns together searching the same area have a 4 in 6 chance of finding a hidden secret. If the combined time and efforts push the chance to 6 in 6 or more, the characters automatically find the secret(s) after the allotted amount of time.

Note that a successful search result still won't find any hidden secrets if there are none there to find in the first place. And also note that discovering the *existence* of the secret doesn't necessarily inform the characters how to *access* that secret, either. That may require additional detailed, creative, and hands-on storytelling, role-playing, and scene exploration.


#### Searching for Traps (ref)

Searching for Traps is handled by the Thief Skill. See Thief Skills, particularly "Trap-Finding."


### Skills

All characters in HAMMERCRAWL! begin play with a variety of both explicit and assumed skills. Explicit skills include the four free random skills that each character gets at creation. Assumed skills are anything that one could reasonably assume the character has ability in due to their background and their class. Fighters and Elves are pretty athletic, obviously, while former Bankers and Accountants are assumed to know math and finances.

The Hammersmith is heavily encouraged to involve these skills as ways to move things along and give out information without relying upon the dice. The *vast* majority of the time, skills should be involved in play as purely narrative flavor. If a Banker is looking over a found ledger of an evil kingdom's accounts, they do not need to roll for anything, and the Hammersmith will give them special information that only they can glean from it. Similarly, a physically fit Elf adventurer should not need to make a check to climb a tree, leap a fence, or rappel down a ravine with proper tooling. In most cases, the 'Smith is encouraged to simply "give it to them" when they clearly have the right skill or assumed background for the situation.

Still, the Hammersmith may *occasionally* feel that a roll of some sort should still be somehow involved, for behind the scenes reasons. Perhaps the aforementioned ledger is encoded in a strange cryptic cypher, or maybe the Elf is trying to climb that tree in the middle of an earthquake!

In such cases, the Hammersmith may call for a test. The player will need to roll a d20 and add the modifier of whichever stat the 'Smith deems most appropriate. If the character has either an explicit or assumed skill in the matter, their target is 10. If not, their target is 15. And if it's something that the 'Smith deems to be vastly out of that character's repertoire of ability, the target is 20.

Thief skills are special, and detailed in the "Thief Skills" section below.


### Spells and Spellcasting (ref)

Given the mechanical depth of the magical arts, the magic rules have their own separate chapter. See "Magic and Spellcasting" further below.


### Thief Skills (ref)

Thieves (and to a lesser extent Halflings) have access to special skills which always require rolls. To attempt a Thief Skill, the player must first have the skill in question as a class feature. These rolls are performed by rolling a d20, adding the associated Stat Mod for the skill being tested, and comparing it to a target number. The target number is determined by comparing the Thief's experience Tier to the Tier of the current Dungeon Level, which is based on the level Boss's HD (see Tiers, further below).

If the resulting modified total equals or exceeds the target number, the check succeeds. Otherwise, the check fails. Each skill has its own details on the results of success and failure.

| Dungeon Level Tier is… | Thiefskill Target |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Two or more Lower      | 9                 |
| One Lower              | 12                |
| Equal                  | 15                |
| One Higher             | 18                |
| Two or more Higher     | 21                |



#### Deciphering (INT)

TBD


#### Lockpicking (DEX)

TBD


#### Perception (WIS)

TBD


#### Stealth (DEX)

TBD


#### Thief-climbing (STR)

While most characters can climb with rope and gear, Thieves have an almost supernatural ability to climb *sheer* walls and slick surfaces with grace and panache. Roll this skill when facing a climbing challenge that would stymie even a well-prepared adventurer. No rope required, in most cases - thieves are just that bloody good at this.


#### Tracking (WIS)

TBD


#### Trap-finding (INT)

TBD


#### Trap-breaking (DEX)

Once the trap has been properly identified, the thief can then use this skill to disarm the mechanism that triggers it. A thief can also attempt to break a trap *without* first finding it, but suffers disadvantage to the roll. Additionally, if failed, they've sprung it!


### Tiers

A number of effects in the game use the "Tier" mechanic as a rough relative comparison of power between two or more entities within the fiction. For example, gaining XP from challenges is determined by the relative tiers of the Party and their Opponents, and similarly the targets for Saving Throws against harmful effects are based on Tier comparison.

**Eyeballing Tier:** Typically a game item's "tier" is equal to one-third (round UP) that game item's associated "level." For Player Characters, this is based on XP level. For Monsters, it's their number of Hit Dice. Using this formula it's pretty simple to eyeball tier differences on the fly. Otherwise, refer to the table below:

| Tier | XP/HD Levels | Adventurer Rank         | Monster Rank    | Treasure?          |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 0            | Common Non-Adventurer   | Dungeon Fodder  | Pocket Oddities    |
| 1    | 1-3          | Skilled Vagabond        | Nuisance        | Money              |
| 2    | 4-6          | Professional Adventurer | Monster         | Gem/Art            |
| 3    | 7-9          | Local Hero              | Serious Danger  | Minor Magic Item   |
| 4    | 10-12        | Reknowned Hero          | Critical Threat | Major Magic Item   |
| 5    | 13-15        | Living Legend           | Legendary Foe   | Legendary Artifact |
| 6    | 16+          | N/A                     | Ultimate Threat | Divine Relic       |

Note that player characters' levels are capped at 15, and as such an adventurer's personal experience Tier will never rise above 5. Monsters and Treasures have one tier higher, because there is always something more powerful than even the greatest of heroes...


#### Dungeon Level Tiers

Dungeon levels have tiers too! A Dungeon Level's Tier rank is derived from the HD total of the strongest monster on that level - aka the "Boss" of that Dungeon Level. Again, the formula is 1/3 (rounded up) the HD of the monster. Thus a Dungeon Level whose Boss has 10HD (a Tier 4 monster) would be a Tier 4 Dungeon Level.


### Timekeeping

1 second = ~1 action phase (move/missile/melee/misc/magic)

1 round = ~10 seconds = ~10 action phases

1 minute = ~6 rounds

1 turn = ~10 minutes = ~60 rounds

1 hour = ~6 turns


### Turn Unholy

(work in progress)

The victims must make a Mind Save. The target is determined by comparing their HD/level Tier to the Cleric's tier:

| Cleric's Level Tier is… | Target | Results of Failed Save |
|-------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Two or more Lower       | 6      | Dazed for 1d4 rounds (disadvantage) |
| One Lower               | 9      | Cower in Fear for 1d4 rounds |
| Equal                   | 12     | Flee for 2d4 rounds |
| One Higher              | 15     | Flee for 2d4 rounds, take damage (Xd8) |
| Two or more Higher      | 18     | Destroyed |

Thus an undead foe with HD 9 (tier 3) would roll against a target of 6 when turned by a Cleric of 2nd level (tier 1).

Success means the targets are not affected. With a failed save, the targets are affected as detailed in the third column of the table above, based again on the difference in the cleric's level

The results are explained further below:

**Dazed:** The victim is dazed for the stated duration, suffering disadvantage on all actions.

**Cower in Fear:** The victim cowers in place paralyzed in fear. The victim loses all of its actions for the stated duration.

**Flee:** The victim must spend its next few rounds doing nothing but fleeing from the Cleric in the most direct and obvious fashion and path.

**Damage:** The victim is deeply hurt by the force of the Cleric's faith. The number of dice of damage is equal to the Cleric's current experience *Tier* (1 - 5).

**Destroyed:** The victim is outright destroyed by the overwhelming power of the Cleric's faith.



## CHAPTER: Combat and Fighting

TBD


### Combat Stats and Details

TBD


### Combat Process

1. Check for Surprise
2. COMBAT ROUNDS
  * Roll Initiative to determine first action.
  * COMBAT TURN
    - Phase 1: Resolve Movement Actions
    - Phase 2: Resolve Missile Actions
    - Phase 3: Resolve Melee Actions
    - Phase 4: Resolve Misc. Actions
    - Phase 5: Resolve Magic Actions
  * Still Fighting? Back to Initiative!
3. LOOT TIME!


#### Surprise

TBD


#### Combat Rounds

A combat round is roughly ten (10) seconds of action.


#### Initiative

At the top of each Round of combat, the designated leader of each side rolls initiative as follows: 1d10 + DEX mod + WIS mod. Highest roll wins initiative. Initiative Ties are resolved in the following order of determination:

1. Most numerous side wins
2. Winner of last initiative wins
3. Roll off

After Initiative is determined, the winning side gets to take all of their actions first, followed by the losing side. Each side must take their actions in the following order, every time:

1. Movement: Resolve all Movement first.
2. Missile: People firing ranged weapons go second.
3. Melee: People making melee attacks go third.
4. Misc.: People taking "miscellaneous" actions go fourth.
5. Magic: People using magic spells and attacks go last.

The Hammersmith resolves this by announcing which "phase" of action is now, and resolving the actions of any characters who are acting in that phase. Players can choose to wait to declare their actions until their chosen phase is announced. Actions are declared and resolved at the same time.


#### Movement Phase

After winning Initiative, everyone on the acting side can choose one of the following movement options:

* **Stay Put:** By standing your ground and not moving, you still get to act afterward in the proper order this round. You additionally enjoy a +1 readiness bonus to any one rolled die (of any size) during that action.
* **Move Near:** You can choose to move no further than your Speed, and still act afterward in the proper order this round.
* **Move Far:** You can choose to rush, moving up to double your Speed. You do not get to act afterward this round.


#### Missile Phase

After movement, anyone making missile, thrown, or other ranged attacks acts.


#### Melee Phase

After missile attacks are resolved, anyone making melee attacks acts.


#### Misc. Phase

After melee attacks are resolved, anyone taking any other "miscellaneous" actions acts.


##### Special: Defensive Action

You can choose to dedicate your turn's action to avoiding damage entirely by using a Defensive Action - sometimes called "taking a defensive position."

To do so, you must first wait until the "Misc" phase of your side's combat round, and then declare you are executing a Defensive Action.

Then you must describe how your character is specifically focusing on defense in the current moment.

When done, you are in a Defensive state, and all attacks taken against you *that you can see coming* suffer a Disadvantage die until your next combat turn. Attacks that come from unawares do not suffer this penalty.

This of course consumes your action for the round.


##### Special: Tactical Action

TBD


#### Magic Phase

Finally, at the end of the round, anyone wishing to cast a spell or activate a magical spell-like effect gets to take their actions.


#### Loot Time!

When combat ends, the survivors gain the might-gained right to loot the bodies of the fallen, both foe and friend alike. This is a divine privilege that extends back to the earliest days of gaming, and is in fact the reason many of us still play these elf games today. Loot gained through feats of martial and magical prowess is the best loot, bar none.


### Combat Special Rules

Alphabetized for ease of reference.


#### Critical Hits and Fumbles

If any of your Attack Dice roll a natural 20, you have earned a **Critical Hit** with that die! On a Critical Hit, total your damage dice (based on Hit Die) and all associated bonuses, double that total, and then apply that much damage. Alternately, instead of doubling the damage you can choose to apply a cool narrative or tactical effect, such as pushing your target into a pit, or insulting their lineage so heinously that they cringe in shame (giving your allies advantage against them for the next round).

If any of your Attack Dice roll a natural 1, you have earned a **Fumble!** result with that die.


#### Shield Bash

The **shield bash** is a special melee attack available to Dwarves and Fighters. *After* rolling all of their attack dice during a melee action, the shield-bearer can choose to declare one of their successful hits as a Shield Bash. The attack does half the rolled damage (round down), and the target must then make a Body Save vs the shield-bearer's attack roll. If failed, the shield-bearer additionally gets a choice of one of the following:

* The target is disarmed, and their weapon knocked beyond immediate melee reach.
* The target is "dazed" until their next action, suffering combat disadvantage.
* The target is knocked to the ground, and the next ally that attacks them gains advantage on one of their dice.

Fighters who Shield Bash as one of their attack dice lose the shield's AC bonus until their next combat turn. Dwarves do not suffer this setback.


#### Tactical Attacks

The **Tactical Attack** is a special melee action available to all characters. Clever players may wish to forgo damaging actions in favor of using their attacks to impede their opponents or otherwise create tactical advantages for their team. This includes ideas such as bull rushing, tripping, feinting, and any actual melee attack meant to confound more than to harm. Provided this takes the form of a melee attack, these are resolved in the Melee phase, otherwise resolve them in the Misc. Phase..

These attacks never do damage, but can instead set up temporary advantages and disadvantages. Any character can attempt a tactical attack, although Thieves and Halflings have advantages to them. *After* rolling all of their attack dice during a melee action, a combatant can choose to declare one or more of their dice rolls (not necessarily hits!) as Tactical Attacks. The player must vividly describe the special maneuver they are attempting, and then declare if it is saved by Mind or Body. The save should be fairly obvious: if it's a feint or trick then it's saved by Mind, while shoves and trips and the like are saved by Body.

The target must make the relevant Save. If failed, the Hammersmith chooses one of the following based on the description and the beat of the moment:

* The target suffers a disadvantage on their next action
* The next action against the target gains an advantage
* The target loses their next action
* The target is temporarily incapacitated
* Any other effect that seems appropriate

Tactical Actions are great for setting an opportunity for a Thief's Stabbity attack.



## CHAPTER: Magic and Spellcasting

Elves, Clerics, and Magic-Users (and of course many monsters) have the special ability to cast magical spells. While Clerics have access to a different "divine" spell list than Elves and Magic-Users, unlike most other derivatives of The OG, that is where their spellcasting differences end. Spell lists aside, all spellcasting classes use the same rules for memorizing and casting spells.


### Maintaining Spellbooks

TBD


#### Clerics Use Spellbooks Too!

Unlike The OG and most of its derivatives, Clerics in HAMMERCRAWL! require spellbooks too! In opposition to how a lot of other games implement them, Clerics *do not* immediately have access to the entire Clerical spell list upon attaining the requisite experience levels. Instead, Clerics must collect and learn spells exactly as Elves and Magic-users, only their are drawn from Holy Writ. Clerics call their tomes "Prayerbooks" but otherwise follow all the core spellbook rules. Clerical spells care commonly called "prayers" and they can learn from holy scrolls exactly the same as Magic-users learn from wizardly scrolls.

Some more experienced players of The OG may call this change blasphemy, but in play we've found that brand new players at one-shot games find that it makes for a lot more approachable experience when playing a Cleric for the very first time.


#### Losing Spellbooks

TBD


### Preparing and Memorizing Spells

Upon the start of a new day, Clerics and Elves are considered to have memorized every spell in their currently-possessed spellbooks for the levels that they are allowed to cast, even newly-discovered ones. Magic-Users (only) are considered to have memorized *every* spell in their spellbooks, regardless of level.

*Whoah now, hold on bro! What the heck?! That's OP, dude!*

Don't worry, fam, I hear you, and beg you to chilly down. Dear Reader, it's important to remember the focus of this game: sit-down, pick-up, meat-grinder dungeon crawling. One of the major roadblocks for brand new players to "Old School" style games is the experience-based barrier of entry to the "fun" classes like Clerics, Magic-Users, and Elves. They clearly get to do all the cool stuff, but for new players without extensive knowledge of daily spell preparation and the entire contents of the Cleric spell list, taking on these classes at the start can be intimidating, and can lead to those new players never coming back to a game they could learn to love. Thus HAMMERCRAWL! takes a simplified approach, aiming to make all spellcasters easier to play for newbies, but still keep them *somewhat* in check.

*Ahem, resuming rules text...*

At the beginning of a new day of adventuring, and following a good long restful session of sleep and morning preparation, a spellcaster is assumed to have memorized every spell currently in their Spellbook.

Spells are usually forgotten upon casting. Spells can be re-memorized by resting or returning to town.


### Casting Spells

You can cast any spell you have memorized. To do so, simply choose the spell and follow the rules of that spell. Many spells won't require the caster to make any dice rolls, although many will have saving throws that the target must make in order to resist the effects.

Upon casting, you forget it for the rest of the day. If you do not wish to forget it, you can instead choose to lose a number of other memorized spells, provided their total level cost is equal to or greater than that of the spell that you just cast.


### Learning New Spells

Spellcasters learn spells through leveling up and also by finding them as loot on scrolls. Each class has its own rules for gaining spells when leveling up.

Whenever a spellcaster acquires a new spell from an external source that is compatible with their spell list, they can transcribe it into their spellbook. If the source is a scroll or other such scrap, the source is destroyed in the process. If the source is another spellbook, the spell remains in the source.


### Spell Lists

This game text does not have spell lists. Instead, I recommend you use whichever B/X or BECMI compatible spell list that you prefer. I find that the *Dark Dungeons* list is pretty comprehensive, and give it my seal of approved compatibility. In fact, it's the list I default to when I run HAMMERCRAWL!


### Wait a Sec... What about Level 9 Spells?

Ah, you are an observant one, yes, you will do well in the adventures to come... So you've probably noticed that due to the 15-level limit on characters, and the progression rates for Elves and Magic-Users, there are no opportunities for them to "safely" memorize and cast 9th-Level spells.

Yes. This is intentional. In the world of HAMMERCRAWL! such spells are legendary creations of the greatest (and most insane) ancient wizards. The Elves refuse to touch them, for fear of the ways they warp the nature of the world and befoul the wellsprings of life. Only human Magic-Users can ever learn them, and even then they can never "safely" cast them due to the restrictions on leveling and the nature of their Highcasting ability.

As for how to find them? Well, dear adventurer, that's why you must always go as deep into the dungeon as possible, to find the ancient madness that lurks beneath...


# Book Two: The Hammersmith's Guide to Slaughtering Adventurers

TBD


## The Basics of Hammersmithin'

Some basic principles to follow:

* **Always tell the Players their Target Numbers!** Seriously, don't waste everyone's time with that pointlessly sneaky number-concealing bullshit. This game is meant to move fast, and hiding DCs and Targets just slows things down for the sole sake of forcing some stupid un-fun antiquated artificial anti-metagame crap on everyone. When they need to Save, tell them the target before they roll. When they commit to an attack, tell them the enemy's AC so they can just tell you if they hit and not wait for you to verify it. Quit that middling crap and step up your game.
* **Roll in the Open, and Don't Fudge the Dice!** Fudging dice is lame as lame can be. If you're going to roll dice, then commit to it. If you're not going to commit to it, just put on the big kid britches, say what happens instead, and move on - no roll required. Throw the bones out in the open for all to see. You can't expect the players to play fair and true to the rules if you don't do the same.
* **Listen to the Players!** Players often come up with way cooler ideas than you ever thought of. Listen to them, mine their passing throw-away jokes for gold, and then use it against them later. The best spur-of-the-moment games are often driven by the players' own side comments. Save yourself the effort and let the players unknowingly do all your work for you!
* **Egg and Entice them!** Give them big red shiny buttons that say "do not push" and then watch them fight over who gets to push them. Place the most stupidly obvious traps in their way and watch them second-guess themselves. And cheer them on the whole time!


## Specific Hammersmith Actions

The sub-sections beyond are an alphabetized reference of all the specific Hammersmith rules for core actions you are expected to take. These are mainly the *new* game rules, unique to the HAMMERCRAWL! experience, and most have been previously referenced in the Players' section.


### The Explore Action

This is the real meat of the HAMMERCRAWL! experience, right here. The Explore Action is the primary method of moving the game onward. Most of the at-table randomization happens when the party chooses to explore and move onward.

Here's What you need to do when the players choose a new Explore Action:


#### Build the Divining Pool

Next, it's time to roll the Divining Pool! This dice pool is built using a mix of regular gaming dice plus the fancy colored dice from WFRP3. **First we build the initial Divining Pool.** This consists of two or more Warhammer funky dice, and possibly additional standard dice based on your game system of choice and any other third-party random tables you're incorporating.

Start with:

* **Standard Blue Die:** Always Start with one Blue WFRP3 Die.
* **Challenge Level:** This is up to the players, chosen at the beginning of the dungeon! Add 1, 2, or 3 Purple WFRP3 dice.

Add any of the following based on in-game actions and context:

* **Did they stealthily enter the room?** Add a Green Die.
* **Did they kick in the door and rush the room?** Add a Red Die.
* **Did anyone actually say "Huzzah!" when entering?** Add another Red Die.
* **Are they exploring without an active Light Source?** Add a number of Black Dice equal to one-half (rounded up) the Party size.
* **Did they raise an alarm or otherwise fore-warn the room's occupants somehow?** Add a Black Die.
* **Are they taking any clever precautions or plans (other than the usual trap-checking)?** Add a White Die for each "really good idea" they have.
* **Do they have any useful tools that might affect the situation?** Add a Yellow Die if they are making active use of special gear, such as maps, potions, etc.
* **Other Mods:** Add more dice based on whim, nefarious plans, the "Scout Ahead" camp action results, cocky player complacency, shifting planes, stock market trends, and whatever else you feel makes sense.

Finally, depending on your game system, you may add other dice as well, such as:

* **d20:** To determine the Encounter Type in Dark Dungeons (pages 219-139)
* **Any other Dice:** If you have any other random check tables, add their dice to the pool, and roll them all at once to save time.


#### Roll the Dice

With the Divining Pool complete, it's time to roll! **I highly suggest using a dice tray for this.**

The special symbols on the WFRP3 divining dice translate to different aspects of both the transition and the next room beyond. These pips create a pool that can be used to more or less purchase different effects to apply to the journey forward. As DM, you pick and choose which outcomes to apply, based on the feel and beat of the current flow of the game. The results are determined as follows:


##### **Comets and Chaos Stars: Extreme Outcomes!**

**Note:** Comets and Chaos Stars *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

These represent extreme boons or dangers in the destination room/node of the dungeon. For each **Comet** rolled in the pool, add +3 Hammers to the results! For each Chaos Star, add +3 Crossblades!

Take note of and possibly apply effects from applicable Comets and Chaos Stars before moving on to...


##### **Blood Drops and Hour Glasses: Loss of Resources**

**Note:** Blood Drops and Hour Glasses *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Blood Drops:** INJURY! When blood drops are rolled (Red dice only), the team suffered damage or stress of some kind in their charge forward. Roll Xd4 damage (X = current dungeon level) and have the team apply it among themselves.

**Hourglasses:** DELAY! When an Hourglass is rolled (Green dice only), the team suffered some form of additional delay getting to the next room. Knock off an additional 1d4 Turns of game time.

Apply all effects from Blood Drops and Hourglasses before moving on to...


##### **Falcons and Skulls: Encounters in Transit**

**Note:** These cancel each other out one for one, and only the *net* total remaining are counted.

Falcons give the party temporary boons, while Skulls give them setbacks. Setbacks tend to be a bit worse than boons, though, but that's just how adventuring works.

Net *Falcons* represent minor boons encountered during travel to the next room. For each net Falcon, apply a boon similar to the items on the list below. These are somewhat free-form, use whatever makes sense:

* The explore action did not cost them any time or light.
* They find the hidden pack of a long lost adventurer and re-up some supplies.
* The party receives a bonus re-roll that can be used to re-roll any single die in the next room only.

Net *Skulls* represent minor setbacks incurred during travel to the next room. Similar to Falcons, apply from the list below:

* Their active light sources flicker and sputter for whatever reason, removing an extra 1d4 turns of time from their durations.
* One of their maintained spells suddenly fails.
* Another random encounter happened by while in transit! (Roll a single Purple Die for this new challenge, ignoring any skulls)
* One of their rations spoils and must be discarded!

Apply all effects from net Falcons or Skulls before moving on to...


##### **Hammers and Crossblades: Encounters at the Destination**

Hammers and Crossblades determine the nature of the challenges in the next room, and any additional rewards they may give. Hammers and Crossblades also set the base XP rewards the party will earn for overcoming those challenges.

**Note:** Hammers and Crossblades *do not* cancel each other out; total them both and apply their outcomes together.

**Hammers:** Hammers represent greater boons and windfalls discovered in the *next room* of the dungeon. For each *total* Hammer in the pool, the next room/node contains a boon such as those on the list below. Each can be selected multiple times, even combined:

* The room contains a(n additional) random friendly encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward friendly.
* Decrease the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The party catches the room's encounter(s) by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Party.
* The room will function as a Safe Haven once cleared of encounters.
* The room is guaranteed to have some random treasure, regardless of monsters or challenges present.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Magical.
* ...or any from the Falcons list above.

**Crossblades:** Crossblades represent sources of danger encountered in the *next room* of the dungeon. Similar to Hammers, options for Crossblades include:

* The room contains a(n additional) random hostile encounter.
* Change the reaction grade of an existing encounter in the room by one level toward hostile.
* Increase the difficulty (or dungeon level) of one planned or random encounter by 1.
* The occupants of the room catch the party by surprise.
* The room contains an environmental feature that favors or protects the Enemies.
* The room contains a dangerous trap that may or may not be concealed.
* One of the treasures they find is guaranteed to be Cursed.
* ...or any from the Skulls list above.

**Hammer-Plus:** (Yellow die only) Some yellow results show a hammer with a plus. That means to first count the Hammer toward the total, and then add *another* yellow die and immediately roll it, adding its results to the pool as well.

**Hammers, Crossblades, and XP:** Hammers and Crossblades together determine the base XP rewards the party receives after defeating the challenges in a room. Note that Hammers *only* reward XP if at least one Crossblade is also rolled. In other words, Hammers without Crossblades still provide any number of the boons listed above, but *do not* reward XP unless a Crossblade was also rolled, providing the base challenge of the new room.


#### Back to the Role-Playing

With the results of the Divining Dice resolved, it's time to get back to the role-playing. Introduce the room and its challenges as normal. Let the party explore, fight, etc. Describe what happens, and move on with play!


## RANDOMIZE ALL THE THINGS

HAMMERCRAWL! is designed to be played with as little prep as possible, relying instead on a lot of on-the-fly at-the-table randomization.

For a Master List of links to various third-party Randomizers, see Appendix R, at the end of this document.


### Random Dungeons

To generate Dungeon rooms, I initially used a set of Dungeonmorph dice and their matching blue-and-white cards (the latter kept into handy dry-erase sleeves). They even come with little symbols and a handy key to them, for adding more spontaneous dungeon features on the fly.

Since starting this project, I've streamlined my process to use only the cards, saving the dungeon dice for more extreme one-off cases. The basic process involves going from room to room, encountering obstacles, grabbing treasure, and moving ever onward. When it's time to move to a new room, I grab one of the the dungeon cards and lay it out as the next room. The pieces are all laid out on the table, and the dungeon grows dynamically as the players explore it.

Conversely, the Donjon website (See Appendix R) has an extremely detailed set of random dungeon generators. Using them to pre-build your dungeon can save a lot of time at the table for playing. You can do the same with the dice and cards, too.

There are two basic approaches to Dungeon Generation. You can certainly do so on the fly. That can add some slow-down to a live play session, however, so I've provided tips on building it in advance, as well. While this does partially-defeat the whole "100% random" approach to play that is encouraged by this gaming method, I admit that the dungeon can be the trickiest thing to build on the fly, and the most time-consuming. To save on time, pre-designing a dungeon is pretty simple using the random dungeon generators at the Donjon. Hell, it can even pre-plan encounters, saving you the need to roll for the enemy types in your divining pool!


#### Building Dungeons in Advance

If you have a set of Dungeonmorph cards, you can instead use my personal method for pre-game dungeon generation. This saves time in play if you have it in advance, and creates some pretty interesting setups.

Tools required are:

* A shuffled stack of Dungeonmorph tiles. I have 90 of them, in dry-erase sleeves, with the tops trimmed off to make placement easier.
* Dice: you need a d3, d4, d6, and d8. Last two really only for occasional exit checks. These could also be simplified to a d6 and d8 as well.
* Dry erase markers: Black, Green, and Red

With those prepared, then determine the number of "nodes" (tiles) for the current dungeon level: Level + 5 + 3d4.

For the entrance, pull the top card and set it out. Roll 1d8 to determine which of the eight exists is the entrance to the dungeon. Mark the entrance with a Green Dot.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which of the remaining sides of the currently-placed tile to add the next tile to.

Draw the next dungeon tile and add it to the side determined. Roll 1d4 to determine which side of the new tile connects. Rotate accordingly and lay it down so the new side connects to the the prior card.

Then roll 1d3 to determine which exits on that side connect through to the previous card: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both. Use a black marker to mark out blocked ways, if applicable.

Repeat process, building out the dungeon to the pre-rolled number of rooms. Sometimes sides will be pre-filled as the dungeon rolls back into itself. In those cases, adjust the base 1d3 to different die sizes to fit accordingly.

Whenever a new tile connects to a previously-laid one _other than_ the most recent, roll 1d4 to determine if any of that previous tile's exits on that side connect to the new tile: 1 = left, 2 = right, 3 = both, 4 = none! use a black marker to mark through blocked passages, if any.

If a tile is placed in a fashion that leaves it with no available spaces to add the next tile, place the next tile in the next best available side of the previous tile, and so on.

The last tile placed has the exit to the next level. Randomly roll which exit gets this distinction, and then mark the exit with a Red Dot

When finished, use a black marker to fill in the "dead exits" on the tiles as makes the most sense for the dungeon you have built.

Once you have the flow mastered, this process takes no more than 5-10 minutes per dungeon level. Since even a single level can play host to a multitude of game sessions, you most likely only really need one or two, tops. With 90 available tiles, the scenery remains fresh for many sessions of adventuring.


##### (Optional) Setting Lair Nodes

A "Lair Node" is a tile where a guaranteed Lair Fight will occur. These will have larger encounter numbers, and most likely pose great challenges to the players. Choosing their locations in advance can give you a bit more freedom and strategy mid-session when guiding the game proper.

Each level of the Dungeon should have a number of Lair Nodes equal to the level of the dungeon + 1d4. The easiest way to place them is to just look at the dungeon you have created, and place them in the mist interesting-looking, lair-like tiles. Otherwise, divide the number of tiles by the number of lairs, and then roughly space them out every X tiles. Placing a lair on the exit tile is usually a fun setup!

Do not pre-populate the denizens of these Lair Nodes! Instead, let the random encounter generate them for you when discovered by the players.


#### Building Dungeons on the Fly

If you're feeling creative and you have the tools on hand, you can build out the dungeon live at the table, as the party chooses the Explore action. For years I would use a combination of matching cards and dice from Dungeonmorph, but recently I've streamlined my method to use only the cards. You can use whatever method you prefer, but I've made notes on two options below.


##### The Dungeonmorph Dice Method

If you truly want a simple one shot, run-and-go, never-to-return method, use this one. There are 15 Dungeonmorph dice available for this task, each one a different theme of location.

To use this method, put them all into a bag, and pull one out at random. This one is the starting Node of the dungeon. Randomly determine which of the eight entrances is the actual dungeon entrance, and note it down.

Then, roll ALL the remaining dice at once, *except for one* - that's right, leave one in the bag. Take all the rolled dice and just assemble them willy-nilly like a wild-person, pushing them up against each other until you have one crazy-looking dungeon. Make sure the entrance die is on the outside.

Finally, roll that last die, add it somewhere interesting, and note it as the Exit to the next level. You now have yourself a completely randomized dungeon made of awesome dice, complete with entrance and the exit down to the next level. Go forth and plunder!


##### The Dungeonmorph Cards Method

Using just the tiles, you want to build a shuffled stack first of as many as you have, preferably in dry-erase sleeves. Draw one, and that's the first node of the dungeon. Roll 1d8 to determine the entrance, and close off the second entrance on that side. Then roll 1d6 to determine how many of the entrances on the other three sides also lead off somewhere. Use a marker to "seal" the rest off.

When the party Explores to a new area, draw another tile. Roll 1d4 to determine which of the new tile's sides connect, then place it down. Roll 1d6 again to determine how many of the other three sides' exits lead off to new places, and again use a marker to seal the rest off.

For each room visited after the starting room, there is a *cumulative* 1 in 20 chance that one of the exits of the room leads down to the next dungeon level. For the sake of at least *some* kind of consistency in all this insanity, I recommend only having one such lead-down per level. However, if you prefer truly organic creation and are down with more, just reset this count each time one is discovered.

If you somehow happen to "close off" the dungeon using the above methods, without rolling a level exit, either A) add a level exit organically to the last-placed node tile, or B) just accept it as a single-level dungeon and call it good. Not every dungeon needs to be a multi-level descent into the depths of Demon Heck!


#### Converting Pre-Made Maps

People like Dyson Logos, Miska Friedman, and Karl Stjernberg (links?) pop out dungeon material at lightning speeds, making them prime sources of dungeon inspiration. If you don't want to make a dungeon on the fly, but don't have time to map out and populate your own from the ground up, here's how to convert an existing one for use as the map for an otherwise randomly-generated HAMMERCRAWL! game.

If the dungeon is already populated, then you're in luck! Use that as the basis for the adventure, and then let the Divining Dice change things on the fly by increasing or decreasing encounters. Pre-populated dungeons are pretty easy to work with, as they give you the basic expectation of what's in there from the beginning, so you already have a stock of options to take inspiration from. You can either use the rooms as-is, or alter them to your liking to fit the party and their level. If you change things up, be sure to set proper Lair Nodes (see above) for periodic increases in challenge.

If the dungeon is not already populated, you'll need to put together an encounter table for it first (see below). And you'll want to determine the Lair Nodes here, as well.

### Random Traps

I use the following roll table for traps. The basic names are cribbed directly from a few hundred test rolls on the Donjon, and then I added my own level-specific rules to use for them instead. I also got rid of Save-or-Die traps because reasons. Most results are based on the dungeon level:

| Roll | Trap                                                                                  |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Acid Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                          |
| 2  | Arrow Trap (1d6 x level damage)                                                         |
| 3  | Blinding Gas Trap                                                                       |
| 4  | Elevator Room Trap (descends 1 level)                                                   |
| 5  | Falling Block Trap (1d6 x 1d6 x level damage)                                           |
| 6  | Falling Ceiling Trap (1d10 x 1d10 x level damage)                                       |
| 7  | Fire Trap (1d6 damage)                                                                  |

| 9  | Flooding Room Trap                                                                      |

| 11 | Net Trap                                                                                |
| 12 | Pendulum Trap (1d6 x 1d6 x level damage)                                                |

# Appendix R: Master List of Randomizers

Here are all of the randomizers that I have found to be most excellent for running HAMMERCRAWL! live and with minimal preparation.

First and foremost, **nothing beats [The Donjon](http://donjon.bin.sh/)** for it's enormous variety of pure randomized awesomeness. This website is the most-used tool in my collection of randomness. It's a vast and comprehensive site with more generators than you could possibly imagine, and I recommend it as the first stop for all your immediate randomizer needs.

Beyond the Donjon, here are some other good resources:


#### Mobile Apps

* [Adventuresmith](https://stevesea.github.io/Adventuresmith/)
* [Crawler's Companion](https://purplesorcerer.com/crawler.php)
* *Dungen* - A sadly no-more Random Dungeon Generator app on the Windows Store =(


#### Programs

* *BECMI Utilities* - An older Windows program that is impossible to find now, sadly. Included encounters, treasure, and a character generator too.
* [NPC's Old School Character Generator](https://github.com/nonplayer/OldSchoolCharGen)


#### Websites

* [Behind the Name Random Name Generator](http://www.behindthename.com/random/)
* [Labyrinth Lord / Basic D&D Treasure Generator (site)](http://www.mithrilandmages.com/utilities//LLTreasure.php) - This site has a LOT of cool generators, in fact, almost as many as The Donjon
* [Wizardawn Character Generator](http://wizardawn.and-mag.com/tool_bxadvg.php) - Can print up multiple sheets right from the get-go!
* [Gozzys Random Dungeon Maps](http://www.gozzys.com/dungeon-maps)
* [RPG20's Dungeon Generator](http://rpg20.com/dungeonGen.php)
* [Dizzy Dragon's Adventure Generator (Based off the 1e DMG)](http://www.dizzydragon.net/adventuregenerator/gen)
* [Labyrinth Lord Random Dungeon Generator](http://www.apolitical.info/webgame/dungeon/index2?mode=2)
* [An older article collecting a bunch of them together](http://inkwellideas.com/advice/random-dungeon-generators-reviewed/)
* [Mystara / RCD&D NPC generator](https://agathokles.pythonanywhere.com/)
