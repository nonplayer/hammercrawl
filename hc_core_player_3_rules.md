# The Basic Mechanic

The core mechanic of the HAMMERCRAWL! game system is the pretty much classic, well-known **d20 Check**. This works as follows:

Whenever you need to perform a Check, you first determine what Stat, Save, or other such character widget you are "testing" with this Check. Find and mentally note its associated **modifier** (it'll probably be on your character sheet), then roll a single **twenty-sided die**. When it settles, add said modifier to the topmost number shown on the resting die to determine your **Check Result**.

Meanwhile, the Hammersmith will determine the **target** number you are trying to beat with your check result. This number is usually (but not always) determined by a comparison of associated character, dungeon, or monster **Tiers**.

If your check result equals or exceeds the target, then the check is considered a **Success** and you get whatever the game rules and general common sense would expect for that outcome. If the result is less than the target, then the check is considered a **Failure**, which in turn commonly means that you have failed to meet the check's objective.

Note, however, that **Failing Forward** is a major part of this game, and as such a "failure" result doesn't always have to mean a *complete* failure. This concept is explained in more detail in Book 1 of this game's documents, as it is a core tenet of play.

That's the basic breakdown of the core mechanic. All other concepts of the rules are explained in greater detail below.


## Advantages and Disadvantages

When a mechanical effect gives you an **Advantage** (aka an "add") on a die roll, you roll one extra die of the same type and keep the better of the two. Advantages can apply to any dice roll in the game, including d20 checks, damage rolls, and more. When rolling pools of dice with an advantage, just add one die of the base type to the pool, and then drop the lowest die after the roll.

Similarly, a **Disadvantage** (aka a "disadd") on a die roll means you roll one extra die of the base type, and then count the *lowest* of the two. When adding disadvantage to a pool, roll the extra die alongside the pool, and then drop the *highest* roll from the result.

Advantages and Disadvantages cancel each other out one for one. Additionally, multiple net adds and disadds can stack, adding multiple additional dice to the mix. In such a case, adjust the number of dice dropped or selected accordingly.

For example, if you are rolling 2d6 base damage, and you gain two net advantages to the roll, then you should roll 4d6, then drop the lowest two. Conversely, if you are making a d20 saving throw and you have three net disadvantages (yikes!), then you should roll 4d20 and keep the lowest single die as your result.


# The Rest of the Mechanics, Alphabetized

As a reference for Play, this section is sorted alphabetically by subject.


## Advancement (ref)

See "Experience"


## Attack Ranks

Every character class has an associated Attack Rank, which determines their base combat attack bonuses.

| Rank | Bonus                                                  |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| A    | You add your level to your attack rolls.               |
| B    | You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls. |
| C    | You add 1/3 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls. |
| D    | You have no level-based combat bonus to attacks.       |

## Combat

TBD


### Combat Stats and Details

TBD


### Combat Process

1. Check for Surprise
2. COMBAT ROUNDS
  * Leaders roll Initiative to determine which side goes first.
  * SIDES:
    - Leaders determine who takes first Turn.
    - Afterward, leader determines who takes the next Turn.
    - Repeat until the side has fully acted.
    - If the other side hasn't acted yet, they now get to do so as above.
  * After both sides are complete, if there is still a fight to resolve, return to Initiative.
3. LOOT TIME!


### Surprise

TBD


### Combat Rounds

A combat round is roughly ten (10) seconds of action.


### Initiative

At the top of each Round of combat, the designated leader of each side rolls initiative as follows: 1d12 + DEX mod + WIS mod. Highest roll wins initiative. Initiative Ties are resolved in the following order of determination:

1. Most numerous side wins
2. Winner of last initiative wins
3. Roll off

After Initiative is determined, the winning side gets to take all of their actions first, followed by the losing side. In the unusual case of three-plus side competing against each other, each side acts in the order they rolled.

When the players' side acts, the Leader designates who goes first. After that player's action is done, the Leader again designates who goes next. This repeats until everyone has taken a Turn.

When the 'Smith's side acts, they are allowed to choose in what order their minions act, as they act, and resolve them one at a time accordingly.

Once both sides have completed their turns, it is time to roll initiative for a new round of combat. Repeat these rounds until one side is the victor, or another suitable outcome is reached.


### Your Turn

On your turn, you can Move and then Act, or instead Act and then Move. You cannot split that up unless rules specifically tell you otherwise.


#### Moving

Your movement options are as follows:

* **Stay Put:** By standing your ground and not moving, you still get to act afterward in the proper order this round. You additionally enjoy a +1 readiness bonus to any one rolled die (of any size) during that action.
* **Move Near:** You can choose to move no further than your Speed, and still take an action this round.
* **Move Far:** You can choose to rush, moving up to double your Speed. You can not both Move Far and Take an Action in the same round.


#### Taking Actions

TBD


##### Basic Attack Action

TBD


##### Cast Spell Action

TBD


##### Defensive Action

You can choose to dedicate your turn's action to avoiding damage entirely by using a Defensive Action - sometimes called "taking a defensive position."

To do so, you must first wait until the "Misc" phase of your side's combat round, and then declare you are executing a Defensive Action.

Then you must describe how your character is specifically focusing on defense in the current moment.

When done, you are in a Defensive state, and all attacks taken against you *that you can see coming* suffer a Disadvantage die until your next combat turn. Attacks that come from unawares do not suffer this penalty.

This of course consumes your action for the round.


##### Shield Bash Action

The **shield bash** is a special melee attack available to Dwarves and Fighters using any non-tower shield. *After* rolling all of their attack dice during a melee action, the shield-bearer can choose to declare one of their successful hits as a Shield Bash. The attack does half the rolled damage (round down), and the target must then make a Body Save vs the shield-bearer's attack roll. If failed, the shield-bearer additionally gets a choice of one of the following:

* The target is disarmed, and their weapon knocked beyond immediate melee reach.
* The target is "dazed" until their next action, suffering combat disadvantage.
* The target is knocked to the ground, and the next ally that attacks them gains advantage on one of their dice.

Fighters who Shield Bash as one of their attack dice lose the shield's AC bonus until their next combat turn. Dwarves do not suffer this setback.


##### Swap Gear Action

On your Turn, you can freely swap between any gear that you are holding or carrying in your immediate Personal Inventory. This does not cost an action, but does require it to be your active turn.

For an action, you can swap between held/carried items and items inside your carried Bags. This requires an action, because you have to stop what you're doing, open the bags, dig around in them, and so on.

Wearable items cannot normally be swapped out mid-combat without explicit allowances by the 'Smith.


##### Tactical Action

TBD


##### Tactical Attack

The **Tactical Attack** is a special melee action available to all characters. Clever players may wish to forgo damaging actions in favor of using their attacks to impede their opponents or otherwise create tactical advantages for their team. This includes ideas such as bull rushing, tripping, feinting, and any actual melee attack meant to confound more than to harm. Provided this takes the form of a melee attack, these are resolved in the Melee phase, otherwise resolve them in the Misc. Phase..

These attacks never do damage, but can instead set up temporary advantages and disadvantages. Any character can attempt a tactical attack, although Thieves and Halflings have advantages to them. *After* rolling all of their attack dice during a melee action, a combatant can choose to declare one or more of their dice rolls (not necessarily hits!) as Tactical Attacks. The player must vividly describe the special maneuver they are attempting, and then declare if it is saved by Mind or Body. The save should be fairly obvious: if it's a feint or trick then it's saved by Mind, while shoves and trips and the like are saved by Body.

The target must make the relevant Save. If the attacker was using a special **Tactical Weapon** (such as a bola, whip, blowgun, etc), they make this save with a disadvantage.

If failed, the Hammersmith chooses one of the following based on the description and the beat of the moment:

* The target suffers a disadvantage on their next action
* The next action against the target gains an advantage
* The target loses their next action
* The target is temporarily incapacitated
* Any other effect that seems appropriate

Tactical Actions are great for setting an opportunity for a Thief's Stabbity attack.


### Special Combat Rules

Alphabetized for ease of reference.


#### Critical Hits and Fumbles

If any of your Attack Dice roll a natural 20, you have earned a **Critical Hit** with that die! On a Critical Hit, total your damage dice (based on Hit Die) and all associated bonuses, double that total, and then apply that much damage. Alternately, instead of doubling the damage you can choose to apply a cool narrative or tactical effect, such as pushing your target into a pit, or insulting their lineage so heinously that they cringe in shame (giving your allies advantage against them for the next round).

If any of your Attack Dice roll a natural 1, you have earned a **Fumble!** result with that die.


#### Missile Weapons in Melee Combat

When using a missile weapon against a target that is in melee with you, your attacks have a disadvantage die.


#### Ranged Attacks

Every missile and thrown weapon in the Gear section is given a Range stat, consisting of two numbers divided by a slash. The first number is the **Effective Range** of that weapon, and the second number is the weapon's **Maximum Range**. Attacks at Effective range are made as normal, while attacks up to the Maximum range suffer a Disadvantage die.

Melee weapons without a Thrown quality *can* be thrown, but the attack has a disadvantage die. Max range is equal to your Strength, effective range is half that.


#### Two-Weapon Fighting

In a HAMMERCRAWL! game, any character can choose to wield two weapons at once - this is entirely a matter of narrative description, and players are encouraged to go wild with their imaginations here. Elf Exemplars are the only characters that receive *specific* mechanical bonuses for attempting to do fight in that style.

Particularly generous Hammersmiths may choose to award all characters occasional one-off bonuses for clever use of off-hand tools and weaponry, as long as it is done so in a way that doesn't diminish the value of the Elf's unique ability. Non-Elf characters that wish to tactically employ two-weapon attacks on the regular are encouraged to instead consider incorporate them as description for Tactical Actions (see above).


#### Unarmed Combat

The Hit Die damage rules assume the use of any number of standard weapons. When fighting unarmed, the damage die is reduced by one step (i.e. from 1d8 to 1d6). If the combatant's base Hit Die is d4, then their damage is reduced to 1 point. Getting punched by a wizard is usually more of an annoyance than anything noteworthy.

When fighting unarmed against an armed opponent, prepare for a massive beating. Unarmed combatants have disadvantage on melee attacks against armed opponents, and armed combatants also have advantage on attacks against unarmed opponents. Double whammy.

Note that holding a shield and/or a missile weapon counts as being armed.


### After Combat


#### Loot Time!

When combat ends, the survivors gain the might-gained right to loot the bodies of the fallen, both foe and friend alike. This is a divine privilege that extends back to the earliest days of gaming, and is in fact the reason many of us still play these elf games today. Loot gained through feats of martial and magical prowess is the best loot, bar none.

## Encumbrance

In HAMMERCRAWL!, characters are limited in the amount of items they can carry at any one time. Players manage their gear using an **Encumbrance** mechanic, which consists of a variable number of "gear slots" inspired by certain popular fantasy role-playing and survival-horror video games.

Every character has a "Max Encumbrance" (aka **MaxEnc**) value, which is determined at character creation. The default base value is equal to one-half (1/2) your INT score, rounded up, and modified directly by your STR mod.

You may have been expecting STR to provide the basis, but that is not the case. *What is the reasoning behind this?!* you might ask. HAMMERCRAWL! uses the INT score as the Encumbrance baseline because in our "delve smarter" mentality, carrying more personal gear is mostly of a matter of smart packing and clever weight distribution. A smart character is simply better at carrying and maintaining a well-distributed personal load than a dumb one. But yes, STR *does* still affect things somewhat in the end, thus the additional modifier. If you're both dumb *and* weak, we pray for your (unlikely) safe return.

Characters can increase their Encumbrance slots by purchasing various bags. Each bag item has its own base, which counts against the character's personal encumbrance base. Once added to the inventory, a bag lets the character collect and carry more items, but at the risk of those items being destroyed should something befall the bag.


### Gear Encumbrance

Each piece of gear has a **Size** value which determines how many Encumbrance slots it takes to carry. These sizes are all intentionally gauged against the Human standard of sizes, in accordance with the ancient traditions of dungeon crawling.

* **Tiny:** Requires 1 slot, but identical items can be stacked up to 100 in the same slot. This is Coin and Gem size.
* **Small:** Requires 1 slot, but identical items can be stacked up to 10 in the same slot. This is Coin and Gem size. This is pocket item size.
* **Medium:** Requires 1 slot per item.
* **Large:** Requires 2 slot per item.
* **Huge:** Cannot be stowed; requires active carrying with both hands.

**Wearable items** are special exceptions to Encumbrance. Any gear with the "Wearable" quality does not count against a character's Encumbrance while it is being worn. This includes things like clothing, armour, and backpacks. This exception only applies while worn, however; if such an item is removed and carried, its original Size then counts against the character's encumbrance.

Aside from adding more bags, **characters simply can not exceed their encumbrance limits.** If they try, they will fail: something will fall off, a strap will break, an item will come apart, and so on. It's for reasons like these that many experienced adventurers hire porters to accompany them!

**CLASS NOTE:** Some character classes such as the Halfling and the Half-Ogre have special encumbrance exceptions. See their class details for more information.


### Bags: How to Track Your Gear

Characters' gear lists should be tracked as separate bag-based lists. The first so-called "bag" is all of the character's **Worn and Equipped Items**. This includes anything held directly in their hands (weapons, shields, torches, etc) and anything specifically worn via the "Wearable" quality (armor, clothing, backpacks, etc). These items do not count against Encumbrance. The only limit here is one of narrative sensibility: you can generally only wear one piece or armor, one necklace, one cloak, ten rings, and so on. And most standard characters are assumed to have at most two functioning hands with which to hold things. Different anatomies and states of being will drastically impact this, so in the end it's up to the Player and the 'Smith.

Next, every character has a default **Personal Inventory** with a number of slots equal to the character's Maximum Encumbrance. These are all the items they are stowing on their person, but not necessarily holding or wearing. All equipment on their sheet that is *not* worn on the body must be either carried in their Personal Inventory, or stowed into a carried bag within that Inventory. It is important to note that **items inside bags do not count against the character's base Encumbrance!** Only the bag's own base size counts against the Personal limit. That's why bags are great.

Finally, most characters will wear or carry one or more additional portable bag gear items, such as backpacks, sacks, and chests. These provide additional encumbrance slots beyond the character's base amount. While the bags themselves count their own base Sizes against the character's Personal encumbrance, their individual contents should be listed and collected separately.

**When you acquire new gear** it is up to you to determine where that gear is stowed. Choose wisely.


#### Stacking Bags

Empty bags can be carried inside other bags, provide they fit. However, bags that are actively being used to contain items cannot be contained within larger bags.

The purpose for this rule is to prevent the Nesting Doll effect. Intentionally, a character can only carry as many actively-used bags as their *Personal* encumbrance limit will allow.


#### Bag Destruction

If a bag is destroyed, so too are all of its contents. Determining this is usually handled as part of some saving throw during the game. For most items, the target for that save is 10. Bags have variable saving throw based on their quality, shown in the gear list.


### How much does that body weigh?

This question is inevitably asked in every game, so here's the answer. The encumbrance of a dead, bound, unconscious, or otherwise helpless body is as follows:

* **Halflings:** Large
* **Dwarves, Elves, Humans:** Huge
* **Half-Ogres:** More Huge (as in: not really a thing, good luck with that!)

For other creatures, use the above as relative guidelines.

If those bodies are *significantly* diminished (usually by amputation, etc), count them one category lower. If those bodies are actively resisting, count them as one category higher.


## Experience

Experience is the currency of character advancement in HAMMERCRAWL! As characters go on adventures, defeat threats, and gather wealth, they will accrue experience points (XP) which can be cashed in to increase experience levels.

Experience in HAMMERCRAWL! is earned from the following two activities:

* Killing your Enemies
* Taking their Stuff

Okay, it's a *bit* more complicated than that, but not much. Read on below.


### XP from Challenges

The primary method of XP acquisition is by exploring new locations and dungeon rooms, and then defeating the challenges within those rooms. When a challenge is defeated, each individual surviving member of the party earns an amount of XP based on the following factors:

* Exploring a new Room
* Defeating Challenges
* Dungeon Level Tier Modifiers

In HAMMERCRAWL!, XP is only gained *after* overcoming challenges generated from the Divining Pool. When the party survives a new rolled challenge, use the following process to determine the how *base* XP reward:

1. **Did they explore a new Room?** Each time the party discovers a new "room" or "node" in the dungeon (specifically after using the Explore Action), start the reward with a single XP. This is based on the "node" based method of dungeon exploration; if you're running a room-heavy dungeon, you may need to restrict this to once per "region" of rooms instead.
2. **Did they defeat the challenges?** If there was a challenge in the room, increase the reward by the total number of Xs rolled in that encounter's Divining Pool, plus any additional Suns rolled. Note that Suns *only* add to the XP reward pool if at least one X was also present - rewards without challenge earn no XP!
3. **Are they on a level-appropriate Dungeon Tier?** Multiply the reward based on comparing the party's average level Tier to that of the current dungeon level:


| Dungeon Level Tier is: | Reward Mod:            |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 or more lower        | One-Tenth (round down) |
| 1 lower                | One-Half (round down)  |
| Equal                  | No Mod                 |
| 1 higher               | Multiply x2            |
| 2 or more higher       | Multiply x10           |


**XP Rewards are Individual!** Once calculated, *each* surviving party member receives the same amount of XP. It is not divided among them, instead being given out equally in full. As such there is no inherent XP-driven benefit to sacrificing party members in the hopes of getting more XP.


**Modifying The XP Rewards:** The Hammersmith may choose to raise or lower the rewards after the fact based on group performance or unexpected results. If the party wins against overwhelming odds, for example, the 'Smith may decide to raise the comparative Tier of the enemies to account for an unusual smashing success. Conversely, if the party is just "grinding rats" in the noob zone for an XP mill, the 'Smith may decide to reward them no XP at all for their bad attitudes about the whole thing.


### Ad-Hoc Experience Awards

Hammersmiths may feel like rewarding some players with spontaneous experience boons when those players come up with good ideas or engage in captivating scenes of role-playing. I recommend keeping these to a minimum, and instead making players earn those valuable XPs through the expected core methods, but hey, it's your game, go buck wild. Use the following as a guideline, based on the occurrence that you feel deserves the reward:

* Hah yeah, okay that was pretty cool: 1 XP
* Whoah, that was awesome!: 2 XP
* (table, players, and household all literally explode from the magnitude of sheer bodacious game fire): 3 XP


### Experience and Money

Parties that make it back to town with a *lot* of excess money can choose to convert some of it to XP. In short, for every 1000 coins that they convert to XP (as in: they *can not* spend it on stuff), every surviving member of that dungeon run gains 1 XP.

For more detail, see "Return to Town" in the "Party Meta-Actions" section.


### Leveling Up

In order to attain the next level of ability in your Class, you must accrue an amount of XP equal to the next level times 10. You must then either use the Level Up camp action, or return to Town.

When you attain the next level, the following things happen, in order:

1. Your XP total resets to Zero. Any accrued XP over the amount needed to level up is erased.
2. Your level increases by 1, to a maximum of 15.
3. You gain an additional Hit Die based on your class.
4. Reroll ALL of your Hit Dice, and apply your CON Mod to the total. Your con mod only applies *once*, regardless of how many dice you are rolling. The total becomes your new maximum Hit Points. If the total is less than your previous HP total, your new HP total is instead equal to the previous amount +1.
5. Acquire any new abilities as specific by your Class.
6. Take note of any increases to your Saves.

## Hirelings and Henchmen

(work in progress)

**First off** every Hireling has an associated **Profession.** This states the scope of action they are skilled in.

Example Professions and associated abilities:

* Blah

Additionally, every Hireling has a base Tier, which determines everything else about their usefulness and cost.

**Hireling Tier Table:**

| Hireling Tier | Daily Cost | Expertise | Chance of Finding | Description                       |
|---------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0             | 1 Ration   | 0         | 100 in 100        | Unskilled                         |
| 1             | 1 coin     | 1         | 1 in 10           | Apprentice                        |
| 2             | 20 coins   | 2         | 1 in 20           | Expert                            |
| 3             | 300 coins  | 3         | 1 in 100          | Master                            |
| 4             | 4000 coins | 4         | 1 in 1,000        | Best in Field for the Present Day |
| 5             | 5 XP!      | 5         | 1 in 10,000       | Best in all of History            |

**Tier:** The Tier is used for all associated and relevant mechanics. It determines the base bonus to related abilities, and the number of hit dice the hireling has should they come into question.

**Daily Cost:** Every hireling has a daily cost that must be paid in order to secure their continued service. Tier 0 hirelings merely require food and a place to sleep. At Tiers 1 and higher, their daily cost is equal to their tier matched with a step on the Money Chain (see the table). Yes, those tier 5 hirelings require you to give them XP instead of money!

**Expertise:** Every Hireling gets an Expertise bonus equal to their Tier applied to any checks related to their Professional abilities. Tier 0 hirelings don't get this bonus, but you probably knew that already - you didn't hire them to be good at anything but holding a torch and serving as dungeon "canaries."

**Chance of Finding:** Pretty self-explanatory. If you're looking for one, that's your chance of finding them.

**Description:** A general eyeballing of how that hireling fits into the hierarchy of ability for their chosen profession.


### Finding a Hireling

Go to a place where you might expect a hireling to be found - that means a town or other social center that is most likely *not* in a dungeon. Ask around, chances are you will find someone interesting...


### Putting Up With Your Bullshit (aka Morale)

Hirelings are subject to Morale, but it's handled a bit differently than it is for NPCs not in the PCs' employ. And for Hirelings, the scope covers not just being thrust into dangerous encounters, but also being asked to work beyond the limits of their contracts.

Hirelings prefer to keep their demanded work within the scope of the expertise they were hired for. When you push a hireling to act too often or intensely, or when a Hireling gets into danger far above its preferred safety level, the 'Smith may require you to make a Rally save in order to keep the hireling's current services. This is a check per normal Saves rules, using the difference between your relative Tiers to determine the target (making expensive higher-tier hirelings more difficult to hold onto after pissing them off!).

If you succeed at the save, you keep your hireling for the time being, without changes to your contract. If you fail the save by 5 or less, they may choose to remain, but require double the daily cost. If you fail by more than 5, they quit your service immediately, possibly becoming hostile.


## Hit Points and Death

Your Hit Points are an abstract measurement of how close you are to taking a fatal blow in combat.


### Game Difficulty Mode

Before anything related to Hit Points is determined in your game, your 'Smith must first determine the current adventure's **Game Difficulty Mode**. This mainly just sets the expectations for what happens when a character reaches Zero hit points. The three difficulty modes are:

* **HARDCORE** aka "Classic" aka "Tournament" mode. Upon reaching Zero HP, your character dies. This is best for one-shots, conventions, and other such meat-grinder experiences.
* **ADVENTURE** aka "Campaign" mode. Upon reaching zero, you're dying but still in the fight, and you burn CON until you die. CON can only be restored magically. This is good for short campaigns and stories where the characters get to suffer a little longer.
* **EXCITEMENT** aka "Safety" mode. As Adventure mode, but CON can also be restored through downtime rest. This is good for groups that want to tell a much longer story, or just want a bit more molly-coddling.


### Determining Your Starting Hit Points

Your character's starting HP at level 1 is equal to the maximum of their Hit Die, modified by their CON mod, with a minimum of 1 HP.


### Improving Your Hit Points

The primary method of long term character HP improvement is via increasing your experience level. Whenever you Level Up, you can increase your HP Max by a random amount. This is further explained in the "Experience" section, further above.


### Temporary Hit Points

Some spells or other effects can give you temporary additional hit points. Track these separate from your actual HPs. When you take damage, first subtract the damage from your temporary HPs, until that amount is depleted. Excess and further damage then comes out of your actual HPs.

When temporary HPs expire, you *do not* have to "pay them back" in any fashion, unless the effect otherwise explicitly specifies.


### Dealing Damage

Whenever you would connect with a damaging attack or effect, roll the given amount of damage and apply it to your target, who "takes" said damage (see below).

Your base damage with all weapons is equal to your Class Hit Die. Some weapons may have special modifiers to this, however. Dwarves, Half-ogres, and Fighters have special damage rules with Two-Handed weapons (see classes for details).

Your base damage with spells and other effects is determined by those individual effects.


### Taking Damage

Whenever you would "take" damage from an attack or effect, subtract the incoming amount from your current Hit Point total. If the newly-adjusted amount is greater than Zero, then your character is still up and active without further modification (unless otherwise specified).

If the newly-adjusted total is less than zero, you are likely dead, or dying, depending on the adventure's Difficulty Mode. See "Zero Hit Points" further below.


### Zero Hit Points

What happens at Zero Hit Points depends on the game's selected Difficulty Mode.


#### HARDCORE Mode

In Hardcore mode, when your adventurer reaches zero hit points, they are dead. See Character Death, further below.


#### ADVENTURE Mode

In Adventure mode, when your adventurer is reduced to 0 Hit Points, they're not dead... *not yet*. First, any damage taken in excess of what would be needed to drop you to Zero hit points is immediately taken out of your CON score. This loss is *permanent* until magically restored (see below). Now if *that* reduces you to 0 CON, *then* you're dead. See the "Death" section for how to proceed.

If you've still got CON score left after over, then you're still up! But you're now getting badly wounded, and each breath you take brings you one step closer to the doorway to the afterlife. On your turn, you can choose one of the following two options:

* Lay Down and Call for Help
* Fight On!

If you choose to **Lay Down**, you drop to the ground prone. On this round and every round following it until you are healed, you must make a Death save. If you fail, you take an immediate point of permanent CON loss. If this drops you to Zero, you're dead. See the Death subsection, further below.

If you choose to **Fight On**, you can take an action as normal! Resolve it, and at the end of your action you immediately take 1d4 permanent CON damage, no save allowed. If this drops you to Zero, you're dead. Repeat for each turn that you continue to Fight on.

*In either case,* while your HP is zero, any further damage you may take from additional attacks or effects targeting you comes directly out of your CON score. Once your CON reaches Zero, you are Dead. See the Character Death subsection, further below.

If your CON has been permanently reduced due to taking damage below zero HP, then the only way to restore it is through advanced medical technology of 21st century or later (good luck finding that in your dirty-ass dungeon), or instead via a special alternate use of the Level 4 Cleric Spell *Cure Serious Wounds* spell (or similar potion or scroll). See the Magic Section for specific spell details.


#### EXCITEMENT Mode

Excitement Mode is identical to Adventure mode, with the following update to recovering lost CON:

In addition to magical recovery, lost points of CON can be restored through extended character rest. After returning to town, you can choose to stick around and take an extended rest. For each week of downtime, your character restores 1 point of lost CON.

The financial cost for this rest is based on the character's social class (SOC). The character must be able to spend an amount of coins equal to their SOC Stat score every day of this recovery. This is exciting, right?

Given that this could lay your character out for an extended amount of time, this is a prime opportunity to roll up a new fill-in character to join the rest of your party in their ongoing adventures during the rest period.


### Healing Lost Hit Points

Healing lost hit points can be done in the following methods:

* **Spell Magic:** Several spells restore lost HPs, with results based on the spell. Clerics as such are valuable party members.
* **Healing Potions:** These items are purchasable at most cities, and are detailed in the Equipment section of this document.
* **Camp Actions:** Special Camp-specific Actions can allow characters to restore some of their lost HPs.
* **Returning to Town:** Characters are restored to full HP maximum upon Returning to Town.
* **Healing Skills and Backgrounds:** Some skills and character backgrounds may imply professional healing abilities. At the Smith's discretion, these can be used to restore one or more hit points, provided appropriate equipment is on hand and available.


### Character Death

Barring the existence and availability of resurrection magic, this is a permanent state of being. Time to roll up a new hero and feed them to the dungeon.

At the time of a character's death, there's a chance that some or all of their loot will also be destroyed. See below.


#### Loot Survival

When a character dies in a dungeon, there's a chance that some or all of their gear and loot might also be destroyed with them. Many lucky groups have salvaged all kinds of sweet loot from the bodies of their fallen comrades. Other more unlucky groups can find themselves trapped and hopeless when crucial plot-specific items were destroyed along with their dead friends. Such is the way of HAMMERCRAWL!

To determine this, at the time of the character's death their player must make a Luck save for each and every Worn, Equipped, and Carried item, applying the now-dead character's Luck Save mod. For most items, the target is 10. For bags, make only one roll for the entire bag, using its "Save" score as the target.

If an item fails its save, cross through it, for it is destroyed. If a bag fails, cross through it *and* all of its contents, for they are all destroyed. On the plus side, if a bag makes its save, there is no need to roll for any of its contents, as they all survive automatically.


## Leveling Up (ref)

See "Experience"


## Light and Darkness

As none of the base classes in HAMMERCRAWL! can see in the dark, having a source of light is crucial to successful dungeon delving. How can you expect to explore a dungeon and stay alive if you can't see?! In addition to all the standard role-playing needs that light serves in a game like this, the special meta-action of HAMMERCRAWL! are directly affected by it as well. For one you, absolutely require at least one light source in order to Camp, and if you try and Explore without light then you add potentially several additional dangerous Black Dice to the 'Smith's Divining Pool.


### Types of Lighting

There are five types of lighting:

* **Darkness:** Complete loss of visual perception, must rely on other senses if available. See deeper description further below.
* **Weak Light:** Good enough for basic visibility, but apply disadvantage to deeper visual perception-based rolls at the 'Smith's discretion.
* **Strong Light:** Good light for human vision, no light-specific penalties applied.
* **Blinding Light:** Without adequate eye protection, suffer disadvantage to visual perception-based rolls. Continued exposure can lead to temporary or even permanent loss of vision at the 'Smith's discretion.


### Common Light Sources

Most adventuring parties in HAMMERCRAWL! have access to the following "common" sources of light:

* **Candle:** Lasts 6 Beats, giving a 5-foot radius of weak light
* **Torch:** Lasts 6 Beats (1 hour), giving a 20-foot radius of weak light
* **Lantern w/ 1 flask of oil:** Lasts 24 Beats (4 hours), giving a 40-foot radius of weak light
* **Light Spell (requires spellcasting):** Lasts 6 Beats (+1/caster level), giving a 15-foot radius of strong light


### Combining/Canceling Light Sources

Some of the following effects may occur in your games:

* **Weak Light + Weak Light = Strong Light:** If two or more weak light sources are combines (such as two lit torches, for example), the result is a strong light in the overlapping space.
* **Any Light + Regular Darkness = Regular Light:** Light of any kind introduced to darkness temporarily cancels that darkness. This should be pretty obvious.
* **Magical Darkness + Regular Light = Magical Darkness:** Magical darkness is stronger than any regular light source.
* **Magical Darkness + Magical Light = Double Negation:** Magical Darkness and Magical Light negate each other out of existence. If either side has a Continual effect, it returns to existence once the other effect has expired, but if both have the Continual effect then both are permanently negated. After negation, whatever regular lighting that previously existed returns to effect.

I must note, however, that these are getting super nitpicky, so you may wish to just ignore this in your games and move the hell on with play.


### Effects of Darkness

When a character is acting under the effects of darkness, the following mechanics apply:

* Their Combat Attack Dice pool is reduced by one. If this reduces it to Zero, they cannot effectively attack.
* They can not perform Critical Hits on natural rolls of 20. Such rolls are treated as normal 20s instead, without the usual double damage effect.
* Their Damage Hit Die is treated as one die size lower than it would normally be.
* They roll with Disadvantage on Skill rolls, Area Saves.
* They roll with double Disadvantage on all rolls involving visual perception (if the 'Smith even allows them at all).

As you can see, being in complete darkness is very much Not Good, so you are advised to keep fresh light sources handy at all times.


## Magic (ref)

Given the depth of magical ways, the magic rules have their own separate chapter. See the "Magic and Spellcasting" rules document.


## Mapping

TBD


## Morale

The player characters themselves are as brave as their players choose them to be. Their allies and henchpersons, however, are usually decidedly less so. The same goes for many enemies that the adventurers beat on, who might come to the realization that cowering or even running away are better choices than fighting to the death against superior opponents.

When a NPC that *is not* under the leadership or employ of a player character faces a life-threatening situation, the 'Smith may require it to make a Morale check. This is done by rolling a standard Rally Save against a Target determined by comparing the NPC's HD Tier against the threat's HD Tier (see the "Saving Throws" section, below).

If no mechanical basis of comparison is immediately apparent, just eyeball the Target as follows:

* Minor Threat: 9
* Major Threat: 15
* OMGWTFBBQRUN: 21

If the NPC passes the Save, they grit their teeth and fight on! If they fail, they either freeze in panic, cower in their boots, wet themselves, and/or run screaming immediately (up to the 'Smith based on the feel of the moment).

NPCs that are under the leadership of a player character are called "Hirelings" and handle morale checks different. See the "Hirelings and Henchmen" section, above.


## Party Meta-Actions

The HAMMERCRAWL! rules add a set of special meta-actions to the mix, which the Party Leader can call upon to move the game forward. There are three of these:

* **Camp** lets the party recover some resources by taking an hour of rest.
* **Explore** moves the party to the next room or "node" of the dungeon.
* **Return to Town** sends the party out of the dungeon to their staging town, to spend loot and level up.


### Party Action: Camp

The party Leader can choose to take a Camp Action at any location deemed a **Safe Haven**. These are discovered when the Hammersmith announces them as such, usually through the roll of net Falcons in the Divining Pool. This requires Light, Rations, and potentially a Bedroll, however. The Party Leader can activate a Camp action at any time while in a Safe Haven, provided the party has the required resources below:

* **Time:** The action takes a minimum of 6 Beats (1 hour; light is required and spent accordingly unless the *entire* party can somehow see in the dark)
* **Food:** Each character must consume 1 Ration

First, each character in the party gets the following action for free:

* **Cleric, Magic-User:** Re-memorize 1 daily spell. **This requires access to an appropriate spellbook**.
* **Dwarf, Fighter, Halfling, Half-ogre, and Thief:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs. **This requires a Bedroll or suitable substitute**.
* **Elf:** Pick either of the above two options, provided suitable gear is available.

Then, each player gets to pick one additional Camp Action to perform now:

* **Rest:** Recover half (round up) of currently-lost HPs (or the second half, if doubling up from the free action above). **Requires a Bedroll and Food:** Choosing this action consumes one additional Ration, and requires an available Bedroll or suitable substitute.
* **Re-Memorize:** Recover one previously-spent daily spell use per character level. **This requires an appropriate spellbook**
* **Craft Ammo:** Add 2d4 normal arrows for your bow/crossbow, or collect as many stones for your sling.
* **Level up!:** If the hero has enough XP to reach the next level, they can apply the effects of that level as a Camp Action. Follow the core process for Leveling Up. Note that it does not heal existing HP loss or restore used spells or abilities (those are separate Camp Actions, above).
* **Stand Watch:** Add a Blue Die to the next room explored, and -1 to Smith's camp encounter roll (below).
* **Scout Ahead:** Roll Search (or other system-appropriate check). If successful, add one Yellow die to next 1d4 new rooms explored. If failed, add that many Black dice instead.

Next, **The Hammersmith Checks for Camp Encounters:** Roll 1d6, -1 for each person on watch, and + the current Dungeon Level.

If total is 6+, an encounter happens while the party is camping! Roll as usual to generate a standard encounter, using the Divining Pool as if an Explore action had occurred. Apply any bonus color dice from camp actions to this roll. If none of the PCs chose to Stand Watch, then they are also surprised!

If an encounter occurs during camp, the Time and Rations are still spent, and all other chosen Camp Actions still occur. Resolve them before beginning the encounter's initiative checks.

**Finally, reset the Risk and Reward Dice totals.** After camping, all accrued Risk and Reward dice are pulled from the Pool, their count resetting to Zero for the next Explore action.


### Party Action: Explore

Each dungeon will likely consist of multiple levels, with many rooms among them. Each room can contain numerous horrible dangers, but also a good chance at wondrous loot as well. Moving from room to room requires exploration, which invites danger but also creates opportunity for new treasures and rewards!

In order to continue exploring the Dungeon, your party leader must tell the 'Smith' that your group is moving on to the next Room - be sure to discuss tactics and approaches before you move! Moving to the next room in this fashion initiates the **Explore Action** and tells the 'Smith' that it's time to roll the dungeon die and the Divining Pool. The rules for divining the Explore Action are in the Hammersmith's section of the rules.

**TIME:** The Explore action requires a minimum of 1 Beat of time, so have light sources ready!


### Party Action: Return to Town

When the heroes finally return to town (which likely involves first backtracking through the dungeon to their original exit), the following happens, in order:

1. Restore all HP totals to Max, and relearn daily Spells and Powers.
2. The party divides up their loot and plunder as they see fit.
3. Each player can choose to spend any amount of their loot to acquire better goods at the DM's allowance. This could take time, though, so you might want to skip it in Con and One-Shot games.
4. Leftover party loot can now be converted to XP. For every 1000 coins worth of unspent loot they choose to convert, the entire surviving party gains 1 XP. Loot converted in this fashion is lost, and cannot be used to purchase goods.
5. If anyone has enough XP to level up, they follow the Leveling Up process.
6. Role-play any town encounters or experiences you wish.
7. Return to the Dungeons!


## Reactions (ref)

See "Encounters"


## Saving Throws

You will frequently be asked to make a "saving throw" in order to resist affects from spells, traps, and many other dangers. The Hammersmith will tell you when you need to make a Save, and which of the following Six categories that save falls under:

* Area: Dodges and Large Area Effect Attacks
* Death: Insta-Kills and Bleeding Out
* Mind: Mental Debilitations
* Body: Physical Debilitations
* Luck: Fate and Fortune
* Rally: Leadership and Morale

When it's time to make the check, roll 1d20 and add your relevant modifier based on your class and stats. The target number for your roll is based on the "Tier" of power of the source effect, determined by comparing the source's relevant power tier to your character's current experience tier:

| Source Tier is…    | Target |
|--------------------|--------|
| Two or more Lower  | 9      |
| One Lower          | 12     |
| Equal              | 15     |
| One Higher         | 18     |
| Two or more Higher | 21     |

For example, a 2nd level Adventurer (Tier 1) saving against the magical fear effect of a 7th level Monster (Tier 3) would have to roll an 18 or higher, due to the differences in their tiers.


## Searching for Hidden Secrets

Adventurers can search for clues and hidden secrets in the dungeon by spending time in active investigation. A character can search a single 10 x 10 area in a minimum one Beat of time, and of course the party can split up to cover more ground in larger areas by searching simultaneously. Characters can spend longer searching, and increase their chances of success.

When one or more characters are searching, the Hammersmith asks how many characters (if any) are searching together, and how long they intend to spend searching. After the time stated, the 'Smith secretly rolls to see if they found anything that may have been hidden in their area. Each character searching has a cumulative 1 in 6 chance of finding a hidden secret in the area per Beat spent searching. If they work together, their efforts are combined. For example, two characters who spend two Beats together searching the same area have a 4 in 6 chance of finding a hidden secret. If the combined time and efforts push the chance to 6 in 6 or more, the characters automatically find the secret(s) after the allotted amount of time.

Note that a successful search result still won't find any hidden secrets if there are none there to find in the first place. And also note that discovering the *existence* of the secret doesn't necessarily inform the characters how to *access* that secret, either. That may require additional detailed, creative, and hands-on storytelling, role-playing, and scene exploration.


### Searching for Traps (ref)

Searching for Traps is handled by the Thief Skill. See Thief Skills, particularly "Trap-Finding."


## Skills

All characters in HAMMERCRAWL! begin play with a variety of both explicit and assumed skills. Explicit skills include the four free random skills that each character gets at creation. Assumed skills are anything that one could reasonably assume the character has ability in due to their background and their class. Fighters and Elves are pretty athletic, obviously, while former Bankers and Accountants are assumed to know math and finances.

The Hammersmith is heavily encouraged to involve these skills as ways to move things along and give out information without relying upon the dice. The *vast* majority of the time, skills should be involved in play as purely narrative flavor. If a Banker is looking over a found ledger of an evil kingdom's accounts, they do not need to roll for anything, and the Hammersmith will give them special information that only they can glean from it. Similarly, a physically fit Elf adventurer should not need to make a check to climb a tree, leap a fence, or rappel down a ravine with proper tooling. In most cases, the 'Smith is encouraged to simply "give it to them" when they clearly have the right skill or assumed background for the situation.

Still, the Hammersmith may *occasionally* feel that a roll of some sort should still be somehow involved, for behind the scenes reasons. Perhaps the aforementioned ledger is encoded in a strange cryptic cypher, or maybe the Elf is trying to climb that tree in the middle of an earthquake!

In such cases, the Hammersmith may call for a test. The player will need to roll a d20 and add the modifier of whichever stat the 'Smith deems most appropriate. If the character has either an explicit or assumed skill in the matter, their target is 10. If not, their target is 15. And if it's something that the 'Smith deems to be vastly out of that character's repertoire of ability, the target is 20.

Thief skills are special, and detailed in the "Thief Skills" section below.


## Spells and Spellcasting (ref)

Given the mechanical depth of the magical arts, the magic rules have their own separate chapter. See "Magic and Spellcasting" further below.


## Thief Skills (ref)

Thieves (and to a lesser extent Halflings) have access to special skills which always require rolls. To attempt a Thief Skill, the player must first have the skill in question as a class feature. These rolls are performed by rolling a d20, adding the associated Stat Mod for the skill being tested, and comparing it to a target number. The target number is determined by comparing the Thief's experience Tier to the Tier of the current Dungeon Level, which is based on the level Boss's HD (see Tiers, further below).

If the resulting modified total equals or exceeds the target number, the check succeeds. Otherwise, the check fails. Each skill has its own details on the results of success and failure.

| Dungeon Level Tier is… | Thiefskill Target |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Two or more Lower      | 9                 |
| One Lower              | 12                |
| Equal                  | 15                |
| One Higher             | 18                |
| Two or more Higher     | 21                |

**Magical Evolution:** Thieves (and only thieves) eventually master their skills to the point that they go beyond the mundane world with in their scope. At their 9th experience level, all of a Thief's special Thiefskills evolve to affect both the mundane and the magical. When attempting to affect magical targets, the thief must roll with a Disadvantage. In each of the skill descriptions below, the "Magical Evolution" sections detail these new abilities.



### Appraise & Identify (INT)

This skill allows a Thief to quickly determine an accurate selling value for any piece of loot, as well as to know important historical facts about it.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a Thief can use this skill to identify magical properties of an item. Only one attempt is allowed per item. A success tells the thief one magical property, if any, but not how many more may remain undiscovered. If there are no magical properties, a success will impart this knowledge. Upon failure, the 'Smith is free to feed the thief false information.


### Break & Enter (DEX)

This is the Thief's ability to bypass security features and break into places they're not supposed to be. The most common uses are to bypass locks and disable traps, but other creative uses are also encouraged. Not that one must first *detect* a trap before one can attempt to disable it...

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can use this skill to bypass magical security measures, such as wizard locks and magical traps.


### Climb & Leap (STR)

Roll this skill when facing a climbing or leaping challenge that would stymie even a well-prepared adventurer. No rope required, in most cases - thieves are just that bloody good at this. However, exceptionally-prepared thieves with excellent tools may receive an advantage, at the 'Smith's discretion.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can use this skill to climb magical walls and barriers. If these obstacles cause damage, the thief still takes said damage as normal as they climb.


### Find & Seek (WIS)

This skill allows a thief to find hidden nouns in the game world. They can follow the tracks of people, locate hidden rooms and secret doors, and detect concealed traps.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can use this skill to detect magical concealment as well. This doesn't allow the thief to directly break said magical concealment, but it does let the thief know what kind is being used, and how powerful it is.


### Forge & Decipher (INT)

This skill allows a thief to both decipher unknown texts, and forge texts for purposes of deceit.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief can attempt to use this skill as a *Read Magic* spell, allowing them to cast scrolls. Failure on this may result in unintended consequences, at the 'Smith's discretion.


### Hide & Sneak (DEX)

This skill does what it says: it allows the Thief to hide and sneak around. This skill is effective for bypassing the scrutiny of guards, and for getting into place to set up Stabbity attacks. Being hidden may allow numerous advantages, at the 'Smith's discretion. All you need is a little bit of shadow, and something to hide behind...

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, the Thief is so good at being sneaky that they can fool magical detection. This can allow them to hide in plain sight as if invisible, or to fool spells that locate specific people, and so on. The usage of this is largely at the 'Smith's discretion.


### Lie & Cheat (CHA)

This skill allows a thief to tell amazingly convincing lies, and also to successfully cheat at every game and deal possible. Anyone can tell a lie or cheat at cards, but thieves are so good they can con the most skilled of investigators, and cheat at the most rigged game.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a thief's lies can sometimes even bypass magical scrutiny or defenses. This allows them to fool Truth spells, for instance, or to undermine magical conditioning or charms.


### Snatch & Grab (DEX)

This skill allows a thief to perform acts of complicated manual dexterity, such as sleight of hand and picking pockets.

**Magical Evolution:** Starting at 9th level, a Thief can perform truly impossible acts with this skill, such as stealing an item too far away to reach ("It just leapt into my hand!"), stealing the straps out from inside an opponent's worn armor, and so on. The applications of this are up to the imagination of the player, and the discretion of the 'Smith.









## Tiers

A number of effects in the game use the "Tier" mechanic as a rough relative comparison of power between two or more entities within the fiction. For example, gaining XP from challenges is determined by the relative tiers of the Party and their Opponents, and similarly the targets for Saving Throws against harmful effects are based on Tier comparison.

**Eyeballing Tier:** Typically a game item's "tier" is equal to one-third (round UP) that game item's associated "level." For Player Characters, this is based on XP level. For Monsters, it's their number of Hit Dice. Using this formula it's pretty simple to eyeball tier differences on the fly. Otherwise, refer to the table below:

| Tier | XP/HD Levels | Adventurer Rank         | Monster Rank    | Treasure?          |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 0            | Common Non-Adventurer   | Dungeon Fodder  | Pocket Oddities    |
| 1    | 1-3          | Skilled Vagabond        | Nuisance        | Money              |
| 2    | 4-6          | Professional Adventurer | Monster         | Gem/Art            |
| 3    | 7-9          | Local Hero              | Serious Danger  | Minor Magic Item   |
| 4    | 10-12        | Reknowned Hero          | Critical Threat | Major Magic Item   |
| 5    | 13-15        | Living Legend           | Legendary Foe   | Legendary Artifact |
| 6    | 16+          | N/A                     | Ultimate Threat | Divine Relic       |

Note that player characters' levels are capped at 15, and as such an adventurer's personal experience Tier will never rise above 5. Monsters and Treasures have one tier higher, because there is always something more powerful than even the greatest of heroes...


### Dungeon Level Tiers

Dungeon levels have tiers too! A Dungeon Level's Tier rank is derived from the HD total of the strongest monster on that level - aka the "Boss" of that Dungeon Level. Again, the formula is 1/3 (rounded up) the HD of the monster. Thus a Dungeon Level whose Boss has 10HD (a Tier 4 monster) would be a Tier 4 Dungeon Level.


## Timekeeping

1 Round = ~10 seconds

1 Minute = ~6 rounds

1 Beat = ~10 minutes = ~60 rounds

1 Hour = ~6 Beats


## Turn Unholy

(work in progress)

The victims must make a Mind Save. The target is determined by comparing their HD/level Tier to the Cleric's tier:

| Cleric's Level Tier is… | Target | Results of Failed Save |
|-------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Two or more Lower       | 6      | Dazed for 1d4 rounds (disadvantage) |
| One Lower               | 9      | Cower in Fear for 1d4 rounds |
| Equal                   | 12     | Flee for 2d4 rounds |
| One Higher              | 15     | Flee for 2d4 rounds, take damage (Xd8) |
| Two or more Higher      | 18     | Destroyed |

Thus an undead foe with HD 9 (tier 3) would roll against a target of 6 when turned by a Cleric of 2nd level (tier 1).

**Note:** Intelligent opponents always enjoy advantage on saves against turning, unless otherwise specified.

Success means the targets are not affected. With a failed save, the targets are affected as detailed in the third column of the table above, based again on the difference in the cleric's level

The results are explained further below:

**Dazed:** The victim is dazed for the stated duration, suffering disadvantage on all actions.

**Cower in Fear:** The victim cowers in place paralyzed in fear. The victim loses all of its actions for the stated duration.

**Flee:** The victim must spend its next few rounds doing nothing but fleeing from the Cleric in the most direct and obvious fashion and path.

**Damage:** The victim is deeply hurt by the force of the Cleric's faith. The number of dice of damage is equal to the Cleric's current experience *Tier* (1 - 5).

**Destroyed:** The victim is outright destroyed by the overwhelming power of the Cleric's faith.
