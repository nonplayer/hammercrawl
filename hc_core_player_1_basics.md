# Welcome to the Meat Grinder

*Ahhhhh... Fresh Meat!*


## About this Document

This document is the beginning of my attempt to write a full HAMMERCRAWL! game system from the ground up. This is very much a work in progress.


### Future Plans

The intended result will hopefully be a recognizable game with inspirations from *Dark Dungeons*, *The Nightmares Underneath*, and *Dungeon Crawl Classics*.


### Acknowledgements

HAMMERCRAWL! in this "complete game" format would not exist without the amazing creativity contained in the followed pre-existing games:

* [Dark Dungeons](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177410/Dark-Dungeons) by Blacky the Blackball
* [Dungeon Crawl Classics](http://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/) by Goodman Games
* [The Nightmares Underneath](https://redboxvancouver.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/the-nightmares-underneath-rpg/) by Red Box Vancouver

Seriously, you should probably just go play those instead, they're much better games with much better production values.


### Cost, License, and Contributions

HAMMERCRAWL! is now and always will be a free game. Very few (if any) of these concepts are original to me, and asking for money for the project would just be wrong.

Contributions to testing and development are always welcome.


# About HAMMERCRAWL!

HAMMERCRAWL! is a fantasy dungeon-crawling role-playing game entirely derived from a half-dozen other similar games which were themselves built up from house rules for the older variants of "That One Game" (henceforth just referred to as The OG) that everyone knows. HAMMERCRAWL! doesn't try to do anything new or revolutionary, instead focusing on establishing a familiar-feeling baseline for 100% procedurally-generated tournament-style role-playing. It sands down a lot of the rough points, standardizes a number of odd inconsistencies, and sacrifices more than one established sacred idol of The OG in order to make the game a bit more approachable by noobs and randos that may plop down to play at a public tourney.

This text won't try to introduce you to the hobby or explain the ideas of role-playing to a novice reader of the genre. If this is your first introduction to a game text, good god, Lemon, I hope you enjoy reading but a lot of the text may be confusing. Good luck, and god speed.


## Materials of Play

A game of HAMMERCRAWL! requires the following materials of play.

### The Basics

* The game rules
* Multiple sets of gaming dice, including: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and at least one d30. You may also find the other "funky" dice to be helpful on some random tables (d5, d14, d24, etc).
* Various writing utensils
* The spells and monsters from at least one other "classic" game (I tend to use *Dark Dungeons*, but YMMV).


### The Randomizers

This method focuses entirely on spontaneous, random play, and as such you're going to need a buttload of Random Generator tools. A good number of these are linked in [the base Readme file](./README.md) as well as at the end of this document in Appendix R.


### The Divining Dice

The Hammersmith will need a special set of "Divining Dice" for assistance with generating threats, challenges, and other dungeon content on the fly. As of January 2019, the HAMMERCRAWL! process has been revised to make use of the custom color-coded dice from the **Genesys** role-playing game, published by Fantasy Flight Games. The dice are available anywhere that game is sold, including online retailers and your FLGS. We recommend getting two complete sets, as that should likely be more than enough for a complete dungeon.

If you go not have the physical dice, there are a number of apps that can be used instead:

* [Heroku Web App](https://rpg-dice-roller.herokuapp.com/genesys)
* [Official Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fantasyflightgames.GenesysDice&hl=en_US)
* [Official iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genesys-dice/id1297007531?mt=8)

The legacy version of this system used the dice from the now out-of-print 3rd Edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. The previous incarnation of the rules for using those dice are now found in Appendix W of the Smith's Guide.

Details on the individual dice and their usage in HAMMERCRAWL! are located in the Smith's Guide.

## The Basics of Play

HAMMERCRAWL! is an old-school dungeon crawl based game. One of you will take on the role of the Hammersmith (aka Dungeon Master, Game Master, Judge, or whatever you like), and guide the proceedings. The rest of you will take on the roles of Players, and in turn guide Adventurers through a deathtrap meat-grinder of a dungeon that the Hammersmith describes for you.

**Player Roles and Expectations:**

* Role-play the character you have created (or drawn).
* Create Story by describing your Adventurer's actions, motivations, successes, and failures.
* Go into the Dungeons described by the Hammersmith
* Lead your Adventurer forth to Get Rich or Die Trying

**Hammersmith Roles and Expectations:**

* Arrange and master tools for spontaneous creation of play.
* Improvise description of the world around the Adventurers, and the actions it takes against and in response to them.
* Create Story by describing the dungeon environments that the Adventurers explore, and the perils and treasures that they encounter within.
* Enhance the world with Non-Player Characters and other interesting denizens.

Both the Hammersmith and the Players will work together to feed a group of Adventurers to a dungeon, and see who survives. Inside the dungeon, the heroes will encounter wicked monsters, insidious traps, maddening mazes, and hopefully gobs of amazing treasures. Those that fight bravely and/or wisely may just have what it takes to make it out of the dungeon, return to town, and level up to greater tiers of personal power and glory.


## The Tenets of HAMMERCRAWL!

**Tenet the First: Embrace Death** - You will die, frequently, and in hilarious ways. It's expected. Embrace it. There's no need to learn to "play better" and no need to "git gud" in this game. It's *meant* to be a brutally hilarious meat grinder. Enjoy the process of character divining, and even more so the churn of characters that replace your first ones, all of which will inevitably die memorably in the darkest of dungeons. And when they die, draw tombstones on the back of their sheets and give them amazing epitaphs, too!

**Tenet the Second: Don't Take it Seriously** - Have fun, and don't get too attached to your characters. Develop awesome stories and personalities for them, but do it all for a laugh. Develop their wants and dreams and then relish when those hopes are destroyed forever by the spiked maul of a demonic bugbear. Ham it up as much as you can, and generally have a good time with it all.

**Tenet the Third: Fail Forward** - One core focus of almost every die roll in the system is that failure isn't always final. In HAMMERCRAWL! you are encouraged to embrace "failed" rolls and push them even harder into success, via the principle of "Failing Forward." This is explained in detail immediately below, but the real short version is that a "failed" roll doesn't always mean a failed action, and instead can often mean that you succeed with consequences which make things worse than you had any good reason to expect. And by "worse" we mean "more fun!"


### On Success, Failure, and Failing Forward

In most single-die pass-fail RPGs spawned from the OG, when you roll a check (usually a d20 roll such as an attack, a save, or a skill attempt) and your total modified result doesn't equal or exceed the "target" or "difficulty" number, you fail at your check. This usually concludes the transaction, move along, next.

In HAMMERCRAWL! we do things differently, embracing the spirit of "failing forward" on every such check. Should you roll a check in this game and score a "failure" result, you always have the option to choose to Fail Forward by declaring that you actually succeeded, but with unintended consequences.

Narratively and mechanically, this means that you succeeded at accomplishing the core focus of your check: you won the footrace, you stabbed the goblin, you saved against the medusa's gaze, etc. However, in choosing to turn the failure into a success, you have consented to Pay the Price.

"The Price" is whatever the Hammersmith deems an appropriate and/or interesting (and usually bad) consequence of your action. 'Smiths are advised to base the severity of the consequences on the difference in die roll needed to pass the check, but in truth they can do whatever they please as long as the story is made more awesome as a result. And the best part is that you (the player) must decide to use the Fail Forward option *before* the consequences are decided upon.

Following the examples above, here are some suggested consequences:

"You won the footrace..."

* "...but victory was given to the Prince anyway, because the game was rigged."
* "...but pushed yourself so hard that you threw up on the King during the award ceremony."

"You stabbed the goblin..."

* "...but they pulled out a grenade as a dying action, taking both of you in the blast."
* "...but he was just a distraction so the bugbear could get a good shot, take 1d8 damage."

"You saved against the medusa's gaze..."

* "...because your brother stood between you at the last second. He's now the statue that you were supposed to be, I hope you appreciate his sacrifice."
* "...because you accidentally panic-cast that Darkness spell upon yourself. You and everyone around you are fighting blind in the magical darkness, but hey, at least none of you can see the medusa now, right?"

As evidenced, sometimes the cost is worse than the success, but that's the price. Be sure to make it fit the moment, and make it awesome.


## Established Systemic Conventions

If you're familiar with The OG and its many derivatives, the following should probably make sense to you. HAMMERCRAWL! is built with the following system assumptions:

* **Roll High:** The system is tooled around all D20 rolls being targeted high. 20 is good, 1 is bad.
* **Stat Rolls:** Class is determined first, then 3D6 stats in order, with highest two determined by the class.
* **Race as Class:** Races are implemented as entirely separate character classes.
* **Skills:** In addition to expectations based on class abilities and career backgrounds, every character gets 4 random skills they are somehow good at as well.
* **Feats:** There are no "Feats" in this game, at least as codified by other derivatives of The OG.
* **No Natural Darkvision:** No characters begin the game with natural low-light or darkvision. The management of light sources is a crucial part of play for every character in the party.
* **Armor Class:** Base 10, Ascending.
* **Time Tracking:** The "Beat" is the equivalent of the "Turn" in older editions (i.e. 10 minutes of in-game time). "Turn" is instead applied to Combat only. A Combat round is 10 seconds of time, thus there are 6 Rounds in a Minute. However, any single combat encounter *always* advances game time by one full Beat.
* **Combat Initiative:** Side-based, then determined by Leaders.
* **Damage:** Weapon damage is based on the Hit Die of the character using the weapon.
* **Experience Levels:** 15 levels for all characters. To attain the next Experience Level, you need that level x10 in Experience Points (XP), and every time you gain a level your XP reserve resets to zero.
* **Experience Points (XP):** XP is gained from exploring new locations and defeating the challenges within.
* **Advantages and Disadvantages:** Made popular by the fifth edition of the OG, HAMMERCRAWL! uses the concept of advantages and disadvantages as well, but with a rather different implementation.
* **Consolidated Spellcasting:** Clerics and Magic-Users have much closer-aligned rules for spellcasting and memorization. This is to assist new/random drop-in players in having fun with playing these two classes, which have historically presented challenges for noobs.
