# CHAPTER: Creating Your Character

You will need the following for this process:

* A printed character sheet or other such notepad
* A writing utensil
* A full set of gaming dice


#### Sidebar: The Online Generation Method

I strongly recommend using [my companion random character generator program](https://github.com/nonplayer/OldSchoolCharGen) for this process. It allows entire stacks of characters to be generated with a few keystrokes. Hammersmiths can thus create a single pile of replacement characters for instant access and insertion into an ongoing dungeon, saving time in longer play sessions with high death tolls.


## Step 1: Roll Your Class

First and foremost, you must randomly determine your new character's Class. Roll 3d6, and then consult the following table:

| Roll  | Class             |
|-------|-------------------|
| 3-4   | Elf Exemplar      |
| 5-7   | Dwarf Defender    |
| 8-13  | Human*            |
| 14-16 | Halfling Burglar  |
| 17-18 | Half-ogre Berserker |

\*If human, roll 1d4 to determine your actual class:

1. Cleric
2. Fighter
3. Magic-User
4. Thief

**Note:** These tables are for a primarily humanocentric fantasy setting, such as that established in The OG. Adjust these as needed for your campaign setting.


## Step 2: Record your Class Data

Each class has its own special rules and abilities. Take note of yours using the references below.


### Dwarf Defender (Warrior)

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 25
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Luck, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Area = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour except longbows.
* **Bonus Languages:** Dwarf

**Born in Armor:** Dwarves in Medium or heavier armour do not suffer AC penalties from low DEX mods. Heavy armour never reduces their movement speed.

**Born of Earth and Stone:** Dwarves are never lost when underground with solid earth or stone beneath their feet. They know the local grades and depth, and can feel air flow naturally. They have a 50% chance of detecting hidden stonework just by passing, and automatically find it if they spend a Beat searching.

**Dwarf Battlemaster:** Dwarves have a bonus melee-only attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, a Dwarf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Dwarven Resilience:** Dwarves have advantage on all of their Good saves.

**Shield Brothers:** Dwarves can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice. Additionally, dwarves do not lose the AC bonus of their shield when using the bash.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1      | 0    | 1     | 0    | 1    | 0    | 0     |
| 2     | 2      | 0    | 2     | 0    | 2    | 1    | 1     |
| 3     | 3      | 1    | 3     | 1    | 3    | 1    | 1     |
| 4     | 4      | 1    | 4     | 1    | 4    | 2    | 2     |
| 5     | 5      | 1    | 5     | 1    | 5    | 2    | 2     |
| 6     | 6      | 2    | 6     | 2    | 6    | 3    | 3     |
| 7     | 7      | 2    | 7     | 2    | 7    | 3    | 3     |
| 8     | 8      | 2    | 8     | 2    | 8    | 4    | 4     |
| 9     | 9      | 3    | 9     | 3    | 9    | 4    | 4     |
| 10    | 10     | 3    | 10    | 3    | 10   | 5    | 5     |
| 11    | 11     | 3    | 11    | 3    | 11   | 5    | 5     |
| 12    | 12     | 4    | 12    | 4    | 12   | 6    | 6     |
| 13    | 13     | 4    | 13    | 4    | 13   | 6    | 6     |
| 14    | 14     | 4    | 14    | 4    | 14   | 7    | 7     |
| 15    | 15     | 5    | 15    | 5    | 15   | 7    | 7     |


### Elf Exemplar (Hybrid)

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Mind, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Body, Area, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour. Armour may limit spellcasting.
* **Bonus Languages:** Elf

**Ageless Perfection:** Elves are immune to sleep, charm, slow, haste, aging, and energy drain effects, *unless* those effects are results of the magic of an Elf (self or other, alive or undead).

**Ancient Arcanists (Spellcaster):** Elves can cast spells from the magic-user list. Elves begin the game with a spellbook containing *Read Magic*. Additionally the book contains a base of one (1) randomly-determined bonus spell. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Elf's INT mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Elf adds one (1) new spell to their book from their own ongoing experimentation, and they can add more by transcribing scrolls and magical texts found in dungeons. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Elf can only cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience.

**Armoured Spellcaster:** Elves are better at casting in armour than humans. Elves suffer no chance of spell failure in Light armour, and a 25%/50%/75% chance when wearing medium/heavy/plate armours, respectively. Failed spells are forgotten per normal rules.

**Blade Dancer:** Elves are skilled at fighting with two weapons at once. When wielding two one-handed weapons, Elves roll one extra attack die, but lower their damage die by one step (to a d6) for the entire assault. At level 9, this increases to two extra attack dice.

**Keen Awareness:** Elves are spatially aware of their surroundings at all time. They have a 50% chance of noticing concealed *non-stonework* doors and panels simply by passing near them, and automatically find them if they spend a Beat searching.

**War Adept:** Elves have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, an Elf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 0    | 1     | 1    | 0    | 0    | 0     |

| 5     | 2      | 2    | 5     | 5    | 2    | 1    | 2     |
| 6     | 3      | 3    | 6     | 6    | 3    | 2    | 3     |
| 7     | 3      | 3    | 7     | 7    | 3    | 2    | 3     |
| 8     | 4      | 4    | 8     | 8    | 4    | 2    | 4     |
| 9     | 4      | 4    | 9     | 9    | 4    | 3    | 4     |
| 10    | 5      | 5    | 10    | 10   | 5    | 3    | 5     |
| 11    | 5      | 5    | 11    | 11   | 5    | 3    | 5     |
| 12    | 6      | 6    | 12    | 12   | 6    | 4    | 6     |
| 13    | 6      | 6    | 13    | 13   | 6    | 4    | 6     |
| 14    | 7      | 7    | 14    | 14   | 7    | 4    | 7     |
| 15    | 7      | 7    | 15    | 15   | 7    | 5    | 7     |


### Halfling Burglar (Rogue)

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, CHA
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 20
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Area, Body, Death, Luck, Mind, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** None
  - **Bad:** None
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all small weapons one-handed, or medium two-handed. Cannot use two-handed human-sized weapons. Can use shields.
* **Bonus Languages:** Halfling

**Backup Fighter:** Halflings can function as fighters of a sort, when needed. Halflings gain a bonus attack die at levels 4, 8, and 12. When attacking, a Halfling declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Backup Thief:** Halflings can also function as thieves of a sort, in a pinch. They have the following Thief Skills:

* Break & Enter (DEX)
* Climb & Leap (STR, with Disadvantage)
* Find & Seek (WIS)
* Hide & Sneak (DEX, with Advantage)
* Snatch & Grab (DEX)

These are used as per normal Thief Skill rules. Unlike Thieves, Halfling thiefskills do not evolve magically.

**Often Overlooked:** Unless their actions indicate them to be an obvious threat, or their opponents are otherwise specifically predisposed against them, a halfling is always attacked last.

**Sudden Inner Strength:** A Halfling can draw from their inner strength for a sudden display of unexpected fierceness. By spending 1 Hit Point before they roll their attacks, they can increase the damage die size for their attacks this round by one step.

**Tactical Attacker:** Halflings roll with advantage on Tactical Attacks.

**Wee:** Halfling size limits a few of their combat options. They cannot use polearms, long bows, heavy crossbows, or any other weapons that require two hands for humans. Additionally, all item encumbrance sizes are considered one step higher for the Halfling.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 1    | 1     | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1     |
| 2     | 1      | 2    | 2     | 2    | 2    | 2    | 2     |

| 10    | 5      | 10   | 10    | 10   | 10   | 10   | 10    |
| 11    | 5      | 11   | 11    | 11   | 11   | 11   | 11    |
| 12    | 6      | 12   | 12    | 12   | 12   | 12   | 12    |
| 13    | 6      | 13   | 13    | 13   | 13   | 13   | 13    |
| 14    | 7      | 14   | 14    | 14   | 14   | 14   | 14    |
| 15    | 7      | 15   | 15    | 15   | 15   | 15   | 15    |


### Half-ogre Berserker (Warrior)

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Area, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons and shields. Armour must be custom made.
* **Bonus Languages:** Ogre

**Chaotic Nature:** Berserkers cannot be aligned to Law.

**Large and in the Way:** Half-ogres stand around 7 feet tall or more, and are built like icehouses. All armour must be custom made for them at increased costs and time, and only Halfling-sized creatures or smaller can move through their occupied space if minis and a battlemat are in use. Additionally, they can stow Huge items in gear for 3 encumbrance slots each.

**Murderous Rage:** Berserker blood is instilled with traces of the same dark rage that drives their ogrish ancestors to war against the kingdoms of humans. When a Berserker takes damage, they must make a Mind save (target: 12) or go into an uncontrollable violent fury. During this rage, they have advantage on melee and thrown damage dice rolls, immunity to critical fumbles, and disadvantage on all saves except Body and Death. On their turn, they must take action according to the following priority chain - higher-listed actions are mandatory if possible:

* Melee Attack the strongest-looking enemy within immediate striking range.
* Move to the strongest-looking enemy within charging range and Melee Attack them.
* Thrown (Missile) attach the strongest-looking enemy within Thrown Range.
* Melee Attack the strongest-looking *standing* living creature (friend or foe) within immediate striking range (Mind Save DC 12 each time to avoid attacking an ally).
* Mind Save (target: 15) to break out of rage: if successful you mind clears and you spend the round panting, if failed you Collapse to the ground unconscious (remain unconscious for 3d6 minutes)

A Berserker can choose to voluntarily fail either save and willingly let the rage overtake them and/or knock them unconscious afterward. They can also trigger it on their own by causing themselves 1 point of damage with a weapon.

**Savage Warrior:** Berserkers have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, a Berserker declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Two-Hander:** When using a two-handed melee weapon, Berserkers roll d12 damage dice with their attacks (instead of d10), applying the result to all attacks that hit.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1      | 0    | 1     | 0    | 1    | 0    | 0     |
| 2     | 2      | 1    | 2     | 0    | 2    | 0    | 1     |
| 3     | 3      | 1    | 3     | 1    | 3    | 1    | 1     |

| 7     | 7      | 3    | 7     | 2    | 7    | 2    | 3     |
| 8     | 8      | 4    | 8     | 2    | 8    | 2    | 4     |
| 9     | 9      | 4    | 9     | 3    | 9    | 3    | 4     |
| 10    | 10     | 5    | 10    | 3    | 10   | 3    | 5     |
| 11    | 11     | 5    | 11    | 3    | 11   | 3    | 5     |
| 12    | 12     | 6    | 12    | 4    | 12   | 4    | 6     |
| 13    | 13     | 6    | 13    | 4    | 13   | 4    | 6     |

| 15    | 15     | 7    | 15    | 5    | 15   | 5    | 7     |


### Human Cleric (Caster)

* **Prime Stats:** WIS, CHA
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** B: You add 1/2 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Luck, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Mind, Body, Death = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Area = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can use all weapons, shields, and armour that are not otherwise prohibited by their deity.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Aligned to the Gods:** Clerics must believe in a great deific cause, and as such cannot be of Neutral alignment.

**Heavenly Power (Spellcaster):** Clerics channel the divine will of their deities to cast spells from the Cleric spell list. Clerics begin the game with a holy prayerbook which contains a base of two (2) randomly-determined clerical prayers. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Cleric's WIS mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Cleric is divinely inspired to add two (2) new prayers to their book, and they can add more by sanctifying, converting, and transcribing prayers to other gods found on scrolls and books in dungeons. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Cleric can only cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience.

**Turn Away the Unholy** Once per Day per Level of Experience, a Cleric can hold aloft the symbol of their righteous faith and turn back undead, devils, demons, and any others that the Hammersmith deems to be enemies of their faith. All such opponents must make Mind saves based on the difference in Level/HD Tiers. Targets who fail this save must cower, flee, or possibly even take damage or be destroyed.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 0    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 1    | 1     |

| 15    | 7      | 5    | 7     | 7    | 7    | 15   | 15    |


### Human Fighter (Warrior)

* **Prime Stats:** STR, CON
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** A: You add your level to your attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Body, Death, Rally = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Area = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Luck = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Fighters can use all weapons, shields, and armour.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Combat Superiority:** Fighters have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. When attacking, a Fighter declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Not Today!:** At first level and each level after, the Fighter gains a single use of "Not Today!" When a Fighter would take damage (from any source) that would reduce their Hit Points from positive to Zero or below, they can spend a use and instead remain at 1 HP and negate the rest of the damage from that attack. These uses accumulate with each level, but each use is permanently lost upon spending.

**Primary Tank:** Fighters have advantage on all Hit Dice rolls, *and* reroll all 1s on Hit Dice.

**Shield-Trained:** Fighters can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice. After a bash, the Fighter loses the shield's AC bonus until the start of their next turn in combat.

**Two-Hander:** When using a two-handed weapon, Fighters roll an *extra* damage die with their attacks, applying the result to all attacks that hit.

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |

### Human Magic-User (Caster)

* **Prime Stats:** INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d4 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** D: You have no level-based combat bonus to attacks.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Mind = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Luck = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Body, Area, Death, Rally = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Can not use two-handed weapons except staves. Can not wear heavy armour or use shields. Other armour can cause spell failure.
* **Bonus Languages:** None

**Armour-Inept:** Magic-users cannot wear Heavy armour, and suffer a chance of spell failure while wearing other armour. In Light armour, the chance is 50%, and in Medium armour the chance is 75%. Failed spells are forgotten per normal rules.

**Bloodcaster:** Magic-users can choose to take damage instead of forgetting spells. The amount of HP damage taken is equal to the level of spell just cast. If below Zero HP, this burns CON instead.

**Highcaster:** Magic-users (only) can prepare and even attempt to cast spells of higher level than they normally would be able to, provided they have a copy of the spell in their book. Casting the spell requires permanent loss of INT score equal to the difference in allowed spell levels. Such INT loss can only be regained through the use of the Cleric's *Restoration* spell. Spells are memorized, cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

**Magical Mind:** Magic-users can cast the spell *Read Magic* freely and at will, without need to prepare, memorize, or roll.

**Wizardly Ways (Spellcaster):** Magic-users are best known for their ability to cast spells from the Magic-User spell list. Magic-Users begin the game with a spellbook containing *Read Magic*. Additionally the book contains a base of two (2) randomly-determined bonus spells. This number of bonus spells is directly modified by the Magic-User's INT mod, which can reduce the bonus amount to zero (but not lower). At each new level the Magic-user adds two (2) new spells to their book from their own ongoing experimentation, and they can add more by transcribing scrolls and magical texts found in dungeons. Spells are cast and forgotten per normal magic rules.

At the start of play, a new Magic-User can safely cast level 1 spells. This maximum spell level increases by +1 at every odd-numbered level of experience. Take note of their Highcast ability, above.

**Wizardly Weaponry:** Magic-users can make use of new special mage-only weapons: The Wand and The Staff. Be warned that actively using these tools will mark you as a magician, and likely increase your chances of becoming a target priority by smart enemies...

### Human Thief (Rogue)

* **Prime Stats:** DEX, INT
* **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level, modified by CON mod.
* **Attack Rank:** C: You add 1/3 your level (rounded down) to attack rolls.
* **Base Movement:** 30
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** Area, Luck = add your level to your roll.
  - **Okay:** Death, Rally = add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - **Bad:** Mind, Body = add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.
* **Gear Restrictions:** Thieves can use any weapons and armour that the Hammersmith deems to be suitably sneaky.
* **Bonus Languages:** Thieves' Cant

**Stabbity!:** When a Thief is using a melee weapon to attack a foe against which the Thief either has attack advantage or is hidden from perception, the thief doubles their damage against that foe on a successful hit. This multiple increases by +1 at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.

**Thief Skills:** Thieves have access to a special array of professional skills which can allow them special unique methods to assess and even bypass dangers. These skills (and their base modifying stats) are:

* Appraise & Identify (INT)
* Break & Enter (DEX)
* Climb & Leap (STR)
* Find & Seek (WIS)
* Forge & Decipher (INT)
* Hide & Sneak (DEX)
* Lie & Cheat (CHA)
* Snatch & Grab (DEX)

At first level the Thief must randomly determine one Thief Skill to be their **Bailiwick**, and one to be their **Failing**. The thief gets advantage on checks related to their Bailiwick, and disadvantage on checks related to their Failing.

At first level, the Thief's skills only work on a "mundane" level. At ninth level, the thief's skills evolve to function on a magical level as well, albeit with Disadvantage in such circumstances. Thief skills and their uses are explained in greater detail in the "Playing Your Character" chapter of this document.

**Thiefy Expertise:** Once per adventure per experience level, the Thief can attempt to reroll a failed Thief Skill check. This count resets upon Returning to Town.

**Tactical Attacker:** Thieves roll with advantage on Tactical Attacks.

**Trapwise:** Thieves have advantage on all Saves against the effects of Traps.

See below for a table of attack and save bonuses by level:

| Level | Attack | Area | Death | Mind | Body | Luck | Rally |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1     | 0      | 1    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 1    | 0     |

| 11    | 3      | 11   | 5     | 3    | 3    | 11   | 5     |
| 12    | 4      | 12   | 6     | 4    | 4    | 12   | 6     |
| 13    | 4      | 13   | 6     | 4    | 4    | 13   | 6     |
| 14    | 4      | 14   | 7     | 4    | 4    | 14   | 7     |
| 15    | 5      | 15   | 7     | 5    | 5    | 15   | 7     |


## Step 3: Roll Your Alignment

HAMMERCRAWL! uses the following five alignments: Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, and Neutral. Roll a d5 to determine yours.


## Step 4: Roll Your Stats

Now roll 3d6 six times, and write them down in order.

*Example: Darla rolls 3d6 six times and writes them down in the order she rolled them: 9, 14, 11, 10, 5, and 17.*

**First** assign your highest rolls *in order of their rolling* to the Prime Stats of your character class. Most classes should have two Prime Stats, some only one, and maybe others three. However many, take the highest rolls from your set in the order they were rolled, and assign them to the Prime Stats in the order they appear on the character sheet.

*Example: Since Darla rolled a Fighter in the first step, she notes that her class's Prime Stats are STR and CON. Darla's highest-rolled stats are 14 and 17. Assigning them in the order rolled, she notes that her new Fighter now has a STR of 14 and a CON of 17.*

**Next** assign the remaining rolls *in order of their rolling* to the remaining empty stats on your character sheet.

*Example: Darla's remaining rolls are 9, 11, 10, and 5. She assigns them in order to her Fighter's remaining stats, which results in a final spread of: STR 14, DEX 9, CON 17, INT 11, WIS 10, CHA 5.*

**Finally** record the stat mods next to each one, using the following table:

| Stat  | Mod |
|-------|-----|
| 3     | -3  |
| 4-5   | -2  |
| 6-8   | -1  |
| 9-12  | 0   |
| 13-15 | +1  |
| 16-17 | +2  |
| 18    | +3  |

Stats are explained in further detail immediately below.


### Basics of Stats

There are six core stats: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). Each stat has a Base Score and a Derived Modifier. The **Base Score** is determined by the initial 3D6 roll. These initial scores are not used much outside of their initial purpose of determining the Stats' derived modifiers. The **Modifier** is a number from -3 to +3, determined by the table above. This number is most commonly used to modify a character's relevant active dice rolls when attempting actions during play.

Each of the six core stats affects certain mechanics, as detailed below:


#### Strength (STR)


**Modifies:**

* Melee Attack Rolls
* Melee Damage Rolls
* Thrown Damage Rolls


#### Dexterity (DEX)

**Modifies:**

* Area Save Rolls
* Armour Class
* Initiative Rolls
* Missile Attack Rolls


#### Constitution (CON)

**Modifies:**

* Body Saves
* Hit Die Rolls


#### Intelligence (INT)

**Modifies:**

* Elf and Magic-User Starting Spells
* Starting Languages
* Starting Skills


#### Wisdom (WIS)

**Modifies:**

* Cleric Starting Spells
* Initiative
* Mind Saves


#### Charisma (CHA)

**Modifies:**

* Rally Saves
* Reaction Rolls


## Step 5: Roll Your Social Status (SOC)

Your character's social status is inherited at birth. Some embrace it, some reject it - it's up to you. This is essentially a seventh Stat (SOC), but rolled separately from the core six, and recorded with its own modifier. This modifier may apply from time to time in dealings within your game world's societies.

The "Coins" column determines your starting cash multiplier for buying initial equipment, explained further below.

| SOC (3d6) | Mod | Coins | Status           |
|-----------|-----|-------|------------------|
| 3         | -3  | x0*   | Scum             |
| 4-5       | -2  | x10   | Peasantry        |
| 6-8       | -1  | x20   | Poor             |
| 9-12      | 0   | x20   | Middle Class     |
| 13-15     | +1  | x20   | Lesser Nobility  |
| 16-17     | +2  | x25   | Greater Nobility |
| 18        | +3  | 1000* | Royalty          |


## Step 6: Roll Your Background

Think of your background profession like a special free skill, and then some. Your character is assumed to know how to do all manner of things reasonably contained within the narrative scope of their background. If there is a question related to that scope, consult your Hammersmith.

To determine your character's background, roll 1d200 (figure it out) and consult the table below:

| #  | Background     | #   | Background      |  | #   | Background     | #   | Background    |
|----|----------------|-----|-----------------|--|-----|----------------|-----|---------------|

## Step 7: Roll Your Skills

While your character is assumed to have many unwritten skills simply through their class and background (see above), you also begin the game with a few randomly determined skills that you somehow picked up during your pre-game life. Explanations for how you learned these skills are up to you.

At creation, you begin with a base of 4 skills, modified by your INT mod. Thus if you have a -2 INT mod, then you only start with two skills. These are all you get. You will not automatically acquire more skills unless the Hammersmith and/or the whims of the game otherwise gift them to you.

If you're using the character generator python tool, this is already handled for you!

If not, roll 1d20 + 1d100 for each skill, and consult the table below:

| Roll | Skill (Stat)                         |

## Step 8: Roll Your Languages

In addition to whatever bonus languages you have from your Class, there's a chance you might have even more. If you have an INT bonus of +1 or higher, you begin the game knowing that many additional bonus languages. Roll 1d30 for each, and consult the following table. If you roll a language twice, you speak that language as if you were born to it. If you roll it thrice, reroll.

| Roll | Language         | Roll | Language         |
|------|------------------|------|------------------|
| 1    | Celestial (Law)  | 16   | Goblin           |
| 2    | Dragon           | 17   | Grimlock         |
| 3    | Drow             | 18   | Halfling         |
| 4    | Druidic          | 19   | Infernal (Chaos) |
| 5    | Dwarf            | 20   | Kobold           |
| 6    | Elemental, Air   | 21   | Manticore        |
| 7    | Elemental, Earth | 22   | Medusa           |
| 8    | Elemental, Fire  | 23   | Naga             |
| 9    | Elemental, Water | 24   | Ogre             |
| 10   | Elf              | 25   | Ophidian         |
| 11   | Esperanto        | 26   | Orc              |
| 12   | Giant            | 27   | Pidgin (special) |
| 13   | Gibberish        | 28   | Pigeon           |
| 14   | Gnoll            | 29   | Sylvan           |
| 15   | Gnome            | 30   | Teenager         |

**Pidgin:** If you roll Pidgin, randomly roll two more languages (reroll if you get Pidgin or a language you already know). You now speak both of them very badly.


## Step 9: Randomize Your Miscellaneous Traits

You now get to randomly roll various minor traits and aspects of your character.

### Random Character Tags

Roll 1d400 (figure it out) once and consult the table below. If you're feeling adventurous, roll twice and keep both.


| Roll | Trait         | Roll | Trait         | Roll | Trait         | Roll | Trait            |
|------|---------------|------|---------------|------|---------------|------|------------------|

### Random Attire Style

How does your character dress usually? This determines the style of your starting clothing. Roll 1d10:

| Roll | Attire        |
|------|---------------|

### Random Weird "Item"

Roll 1d50 to determine what your random weird item is. Some of these may not make sense as items, but trust me, they are. Keep them wherever you like, they require no encumbrance, and they can be looted (sometimes unwillingly!) upon your death. Have fun with them.

## Step 10: Determine Your Starting Funds, Equipment, and Spells


### Free Starting Gear

All characters begin with the following for free:

* a Satchel (S; Qualities: Bag [5], Fragile, Wearable), containing:
* 1d4 fresh rations (S)
* 1 Torch (S)
* 1 set of clothes to match your rolled attire (M, Wearable)

Additionally, some classes begin with additional starting equipment:

* **Dwarves**: 1 weapon of choice, and 1 small shield
* **Elves**: 1 weapon of choice, and a Spellbook
* **Halflings**: 1 weapon of choice, and a set of Thieves' Tools
* **Half-Ogres**: 1 melee weapon of choice
* **Human Clerics**: a Holy Symbol, and a Prayer Book
* **Human Fighters**: 3 weapons of choice, or 2 weapons and 1 small shield
* **Human Thieves**: a set of Thieves' Tools, and a Dagger
* **Human Wizards**: a Spellbook, and a random wizard weapon (see "Wizard Weapons" in the "Gear" section of this document)

Then determine your gear either through deliberate purchase or through random roll:


### Option A: Purchasing Your Starting Gear

Multiply your SOC score by its associated multiplier, and that's how much money you have to spend. Use the Equipment section of this book to purchase anything you can afford.


#### A Note on Royalty

You read that right, Royalty is rich as fuck and starts with 1000 coins. Enjoy the comforts of a shitload of money, buy all the things you want, and see how long that works out for you down there in that awful, horrible, no-good dungeon...


#### A Note on Scum

If you are lucky enough to roll into Scum as your social status, do not dismay, for you may have just lucked out. Enjoy three completely random rolls on the 'Smith's magic items tables. These are guaranteed to not survive your character's final death, and as such cannot be looted from your body.


### Option B: Randomizing Your Starting Gear

Instead of buying equipment, you can roll it. If you're using the character generator python tool, this is already handled for you!

If not, this section is pending until I get the lists converted from that code...


### Starting Spells

If you're a spellcaster character, part of your "gear" includes a book where you keep those spells or prayers. Now is the time to determine what is in there.

Your class determines how many spells are in your starting spell or prayer book. If your Hammersmith is the generous sort, they may allow you to pick *one* of your spells. All other spells should be randomly rolled on the appropriate Level 1 spell list for your class. See the Magic section at the end of this document for class-based spell lists and descriptions.


## Step 11: Confirm and Note Important Sub-Stats

* **Experience Level** (1) and associated **Character Tier** (1)
* **Hit Die** = Determined by your Class
* **Hit Points (HPs)** = Your Maximum Hit Die, plus your Con Mod, minimum of 1.
* **Armor Class (AC)** = 10 + DEX mod + AC mod from any Armour and Shields
* **Melee Attack Modifier** = STR mod + any class mods
* **Melee Damage Modifier** = STR mod
* **Missile Attack Modifier** = DEX mod + any class mods
* **Movement Speed** = determined by class (human base is 30)
* **Maximum Encumbrance (MaxEnc)** = 1/2 your INT score (rounded down), plus your STR mod.


## Step 12: Name Your Characters

Now it's time to give the character a name. Thing is, *you* don't get to give it that name. Instead, pass your character sheet to the player (*not* the Smith) sitting to your left. *They* get to name your character, and they are encouraged to Go Wild.


## Step 13: Determine Party (Player) Roles

Hopefully the rest of your group has been making your characters alongside one another, and you've now all reached this point together. It's time to determine the party roles, which are mainly for administration and also for the use of the special new Party Actions.

**The Roles to Assign:**

* **Party Leader:** This player is responsible for choosing Initiative orders, and for informing the Hammersmith when the party moves on or takes any of the Party Actions.
* **Mapper:** This player is responsible for translating the Hammersmith's descriptions to a map that the party can use, in whatever artistic fashion the player sees fit.
* **Timekeeper:** The player tracks the passage of game Beats, and keeps track of who is carrying what light sources (and how much time is left on them).


## Now Take It All In

Take a moment to think about the kind of person your character is. Think about their goals, their ambitions, their reasons for doing the things they do. And while you're at it, take a long hard moment to ponder exactly what kind of person they have to be in order to willingly leave everything behind and delve into terrifying and disgusting dungeons.

## Extended Equipment Details

The following sub-sections contain collections of extended descriptions of specific items, organized in sections that should be familiar to players of the classic game systems. The alphabetically-sorted contents of each sub-section are by no means exhaustive, instead meant to focus primarily on items which require specific additional description beyond the obvious.


### Equipment Qualities

Be they weapons, armour, or various adventuring tools, all items of gear can be assigned some special qualities. The following list of qualities applies to all the items in this equipment section.

**2H:** This melee weapon must be used with both hands at once. This can trigger certain class-specific combat abilities.

**Bag:** This item adds additional encumbrance slots to the character's inventory.

**Basic:** This is a pretty standard weapon. No special rules, costs 10 coins (usually), and hurts things using your character's Hit Die. The name of the individual weapon is largely just a component to provide narrative color for your character and their combat actions.

**Durable:** This item enjoys an advantage on all its saving throws.

**Fragile:** This item suffers a disadvantage on all its saving throws.

**Reach:** These melee weapons aren't functional within many tight dungeon corridors and spaces, but they provide superior reach in more open combat spaces. When applicable, they give their wielder advantage on melee combat attacks against enemies attacking with non-Reach melee weapons.

**Tactical:** These weapons do not do normal Hit Die based damage. Instead, they can be used as tactical weapons, applying various "status" effects as seen appropriate by the player and the 'Smith. See "Tactical Attacks" in the combat section.

**Thrown:** This melee weapon can be effectively used as a thrown weapon.

**Wearable:** This item can be equipped directly to the character's person, not requiring encumbrance when worn.


### Weapons & Ammunition

**Weapons Table**

* **Name:** The name of the weapon
* **Size:** The encumbrance size when stowed
* **Type:** The type (Melee, Missle, or Special)
* **Cost:** How many coins to purchase the weapon
* **Qualities:** Any special item qualities for the weapon
* **Range:** If Missile or Thrown, shows range in two numbers: Effective/Maximum. See Combat rules for more information.

**Ammunition Table**

**Important Note:** All ammo is purchased in units of 10.

| Ammo           | Size | Cost |
|----------------|------|------|
| Arrows         | S    | 10   |
| Crossbow Bolts | S    | 10   |
| Sling Bullets  | T    | 10   |
| Slingstones*   | T    | Free |

**Blackjack:** Blackjacks can be used as regular melee weapons (doing regular damage), or instead as melee Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Blowgun:** Bolas are missile weapons primarily designed as a mechanism for long-range delivery of poisons. They do no base damage, instead serving as ranged Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Bola:** Bolas are thrown weapons which do no damage, instead serving as ranged Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Net:** Nets are "close-ranged missile" tactical weapons, designed to be held in one hand (or attached at the hip) and thrown with the other, entangling a nearby opponent to either capture them or immobilize them for better attacking. They function as "missile" type weapons, using DEX-modified attacks, but have a melee-only range. Nets do not do damage, instead serving as ranged Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.

**Shield Weapons:** Some shields have special attached weaponry, such as horns, knives, swords, and tusks. In mechanical terms, these are versatile weapons, which can be used either offensively (as their attached weapons) or defensively (giving shield AC bonuses). The player using it must decide each round how they are using it, applying the result until their next subsequent round. See also "Armour & Shields," below.

**Sling and Slingstones:** The base listed stats for the sling assume the user is equipped with actual crafted sling bullets as their choice of ammunition. However, in a pinch a sling user can feasibly put any small hard object into the sling for use as ammunition: coins, marbles, stones off the ground, etc. Any of these items not specifically crafted as sling bullets is considered a "slingstone" for the purpose of mechanics. When using slingstones, reduce damage by -1 (to a minimum of 1) and reduce base range by half (i.e. 40/80).

**Sword, Bastard:** This sword can be used one-handed or two-handed. If used two-handed, it can make use of class-specific 2H bonuses. If used one-handed, it counts as a Basic weapon.

**Whip:** Whips are melee weapons which do no damage, instead serving as melee Tactical Weapons. See **Tactical Attacks** in the Combat Chapter.


### Armour & Shields

**Armour Table**

Descriptors:

* **Name:** The name of the armour
* **Type:** Whether the armour is Light, Heavy, or Plate
* **AC:** The character's AC while wearing the armour
* **Size:** Encumbrance requirement when not worn
* **Cost:** In coins, to have crafted by an armoursmith of suitable skill (With a few exceptions, armour is rarely available for immediate purchase)

| Shield, Weapon | 1*  | M    | 100  |
| Shield, Tower  | 2   | L    | 100  |

**Shield Weapons:** Shield Weapons can be used as either Shields or hand weapons. If used defensively, they provide standard shield bonuses (+1 to AC). If used offensively, they instead function as their attached weapons.


### Adventuring Gear

In addition to trusty blades and sturdy mail, every adventurer should make sure and kit up with a versatile array of adventuring tools. The vast majority of these have no direct mechanical application, instead existing to serve as situational tools in the story. Sure, you might not need a big iron cooking pot every single moment of the delve, and carrying it everywhere is a gigantic pain in the butt, but you'll regret leaving it behind when the 'Smith decides that one is needed!

In the HAMMERCRAWL! game, adventuring gear is assigned to three different categories based entirely on their costs:

* **Common Gear** is usually easily purchasable at even the smallest of towns, provided a general store is around. This gear always costs a base of a single coin.
* **Rare Gear** is bought at an additional premium, usually due to some mix of being complex in craft, specific in application, and/or made of more expensive materials. This gear always costs a base of 10 coins.
* **Specialty Gear** is anything that is super specialized and/or quite expensive to make. This gear costs a base of 100 coins, and can be quite difficult to acquire in all but the largest cities.

Although the **Bags** have been separated into a fourth sub-section for ease of reference, they are similarly broken into the above three categories based on cost.

The main gear tables below use the following notations:

* **Name:** The name of the item. If there are parenthesis, they contain the base unit and quantity of initial purchase. If no numerical quantity is stated, the quantity is 1.
* **Size:** The Encumbrance size of 1 quantity of the base item (Tiny/Small/Medium/large/Huge). See Encumbrance rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter for more details.
* **Cost:** How many coins are required to purchase the item (when available) at appropriate vendors.

**NOTE:** For any entry with an asterisk in its data, see the section below the table for further details.

**Antitoxin:** When consumed, you gain advantage on Body saves vs poison effects for the next hour. If you are already poisoned, consuming antitoxin allows you to immediately attempt a new save.

**Bandoliers:** When worn, these provide three gear slots which can hold nothing larger than Small in size. This effectively allows for up to 30 identical small items, or 300 identical tiny items.

**Bedroll:** Fulfills rest requirements for camping HP recovery actions.

**Candle:** Primarily used as a single-person light source. A lit candle lasts 6 Beats, giving a 5-foot radius of weak light. See the "Light and Darkness" rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter.

**Case, Scroll:** Scroll cases are specialized bag items designed solely for the purpose of safely transporting paper. Each case can safely hold either a single spell scroll, or up to five rolled-up maps or other documents.

**Clothing:** Includes a small variety of items of the listed class of attire. Includes suitable shoes or boots. Usually required for social functions.

**Healing Potion:** Requires a full round to consume, healing 1d6+1 HP.

**Lantern:** Primarily used as a group bright light sources. Making use of a Lantern for this purpose requires the expenditure of one flask worth of lantern oil. A lit lantern lasts 24 Beats (4 hours), giving a 40-foot radius of weak light. See the "Light and Darkness" rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter for further details.

**Lantern Hook:** A special rigged hook that attaches to a backpack and curves over the character's head. Can mount (contain) a single lantern overhead, allowing an active light source without a dedicated hand to hold it. Adds significant height, and counts against the backpacks slots.

**Quiver:** Quivers are specialized bag items designed solely for the purpose of safely transporting ammunition for Bows and Crossbows. Each "slot" in the bag can hold either arrows or bolts.

**Rations, All:** Required for camping and a few other effects. Fresh rations are cheapest, but spoil quickly. Preserved rations are expensive, but resist spoilage in dungeons.

**Sacks, All:** Sacks are handy bag items common to all adventuring lifestyles. Of special note, while empty, folded, and stowed away, sacks count as one size smaller. This is already shown on the bag table.

**Torch:** Primarily used as a small-group limited light source. A lit torch lasts 6 Beats (1 hour), giving a 20-foot radius of weak light. See the "Light and Darkness" rules in the "Playing Your Character" chapter.


### Wizard Weapons

Magic-Users (and *only* Magic-Users) have access to a special class of "common" magic items commonly referred to as **Wizard Weapons**. Owing mainly to their renowned squishiness in adventuring parties, wizards across the known world have developed specialist weapons that allow them a chance of contributing more to their adventures than just a handful of spells each day.

There are two specific types of Wizard Weapons in HAMMERCRAWL!: battle wands and battle staves. A **Battle Wand** is a custom-crafted piece of short-range artillery that functions almost identical to a sling in basic combat mechanics. They are Medium one-handed weapons do 1d4 damage at 80/160 range, and use DEX as their attack modifier. They have effectively infinite ammo, but on an attack roll of natural 1 they fizzle out. To recharge a fizzled battle wand, the magic-user must "sacrifice" one of their currently-known spells to empower the wand, forgetting that spell until rememorized.

A **Battle Staff** is meant as more of a defensive item. It functions as a basic Staff for purposes of combat attacks. If a magic-user spends his combat turn taking no action other than gripping the staff with both hands, their AC is raised by +2 until their next action. If hit by a natural 20 attack, the staff is drained of defensive power, and must be recharged using a method identical to that for charging battle wands.

Each battle wand and staff is a unique item, from the base components of its crafting to the energy it exudes. Use the table below to randomly determine the properties of yours.
