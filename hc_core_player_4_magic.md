# CHAPTER: Magic and Spellcasting

Elves, Clerics, and Magic-Users (and of course many monsters) have the special ability to cast magical spells. While Clerics have access to a different "divine" spell list than Elves and Magic-Users, unlike most other derivatives of The OG, that is where their spellcasting differences end. Spell lists aside, all spellcasting classes use the same rules for memorizing and casting spells.


## Spellcasting

TBD


### Spellbooks


#### Clerics Use Spellbooks Too!

Unlike The OG and most of its derivatives, Clerics in HAMMERCRAWL! require spellbooks too! In opposition to how a lot of other games implement them, Clerics *do not* immediately have access to the entire Clerical spell list upon attaining the requisite experience levels. Instead, Clerics must collect and learn spells exactly as Elves and Magic-users, only their are drawn from Holy Writ. Clerics call their tomes "Prayerbooks" but otherwise follow all the core spellbook rules. Clerical spells care commonly called "prayers" and they can learn from holy scrolls exactly the same as Magic-users learn from wizardly scrolls.

Some more experienced players of The OG may call this change blasphemy, but in play we've found that brand new players at one-shot games find that it makes for a lot more approachable experience when playing a Cleric for the very first time.


#### Losing and Restoring Spellbooks

TBD

Ideas:

* Can attempt to recreate a lost spellbook from astral fragments of previously-cast spells, permanently bound to the caster's soul by simple consequence of them having had the audacity to meddle with magic in the first place. Requires materials, costs, etc. Possibly Read Magic? Chance of recovery, of mishap, or of recovering a previously-unknown spell instead! Hmmm...


### Preparing and Memorizing Spells

Upon the start of a new day, Clerics and Elves are considered to have memorized every spell in their currently-possessed spellbooks for the levels that they are allowed to cast, even newly-discovered ones. Magic-Users (only) are considered to have memorized *every* spell in their spellbooks, regardless of level.

*Whoah now, hold on bro! What the heck?! That's OP, dude!*

Don't worry, fam, I hear you, and beg you to chilly down. Dear Reader, it's important to remember the focus of this game: sit-down, pick-up, meat-grinder dungeon crawling. One of the major roadblocks for brand new players to "Old School" style games is the experience-based barrier of entry to the "fun" classes like Clerics, Magic-Users, and Elves. They clearly get to do all the cool stuff, but for new players without extensive knowledge of daily spell preparation and the entire contents of the Cleric spell list, taking on these classes at the start can be intimidating, and can lead to those new players never coming back to a game they could learn to love. Thus HAMMERCRAWL! takes a simplified approach, aiming to make all spellcasters easier to play for newbies, but still keep them *somewhat* in check.

*Ahem, resuming rules text...*

At the beginning of a new day of adventuring, and following a good long restful session of sleep and morning preparation, a spellcaster is assumed to have memorized every spell currently in their Spellbook.

Spells are usually forgotten upon casting. Spells can be re-memorized by resting or returning to town.


### Casting Spells

You can cast any spell you have memorized. To do so, simply choose the spell and follow the rules of that spell. Many spells won't require the caster to make any dice rolls, although many will have saving throws that the target must make in order to resist the effects.

Upon casting, you forget it for the rest of the day. If you do not wish to forget it, you can instead choose to lose a number of other memorized spells, provided their total level cost is equal to or greater than that of the spell that you just cast.


#### Spell Components

The casting of spells uses three basic components: Verbal, Somatic, and Material (optional). Due to the chaotic and sometimes ridiculous whims of the HAMMERCRAWL! ethersphere, the involvement of required components is not just required, but is required to be *awesome* in action. Each spell in the later compendium is listed along with its required components. These components are detailed below.

A spell with a **Verbal** component requires that the caster *loudly* and *audibly* speak words of magic. If the caster is unable to speak these words for whatever reason, they cannot cast the spell. These words of magic can sound however the player ultimately wants them to, and if the player chooses to actualize them at the gaming table for all to hear, then the target receives a Bane on its save, if applicable. Note that the 'Smith's casters receive this same privilege...

A spell with a **Somatic** component requires that the caster engage in some form of exaggerated physical movement or performance in order to actualize its magical power. This most commonly involves X-TREEM Finger Wiggling (TM), but accommodations can also be made for players who choose to involve other forms of motion, such as ballet, twerking, or interpretive dance. If the caster is prevented from engaging in their "style" of somatic motion, then they are unable to case the spell. As with verbal components, players are encouraged to passionately perform these motions for all to see, with the chance of giving their opponents Banes on their saves.

Finally, **Material** components are entirely optional physical objects that the player can sacrifice in order to empower their spells. Pickled griffon's feet, petrified minotaur genitals, powdered elf bones, all are things that can be used to empower spells, provided the theme of the item and the effects of the spell align. Using such components is entirely optional and ultimately up to the feel of your gaming table. If applicable, the 'Smith may choose to allow casters to sacrifice components in order to remember spells, or overcast, or penalize opponents' saves, or more. You are encouraged to get creative.


#### On Reversible Spells

Although this game largely draws from the ol' Cyclopedia, there are no "Reversible" Spells in HAMMERCRAWL! Any reversible spells translated from older editions are done so as their two separate component spells. This at least somewhat cuts back on the power of casters, in light of their "cast anything!" abilities.


### Learning New Spells

Spellcasters learn spells through leveling up and also by finding them as loot on scrolls. Each class has its own rules for gaining spells when leveling up.

Whenever a spellcaster acquires a new spell from an external source that is compatible with their spell list, they can transcribe it into their spellbook. If the source is a scroll or other such scrap, the source is destroyed in the process. If the source is another spellbook, the spell remains in the source.


### Spell Lists

This game text does not *yet* have extensive spell lists, but over time it will certainly grow them out. In the meantime, I recommend you use whichever B/X or BECMI compatible spell list that you prefer. I find that the *Dark Dungeons* list is pretty comprehensive, and give it my seal of approved compatibility. In fact, it's the list I default to when I run HAMMERCRAWL!

# Spells Detailed

The growing collection of detailed spells is below, sorted alphabetically

Template:

* **Level**
* **Components:**
* **Target:**

* **Effect:**


#### Spells A


##### Analyse

* **Level** Magic-User 1
* **Components:**
* **Target:** One item
* **Range:** Touch
* **Duration:** Instant
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** The caster identifies if an item is magical, and if so, learns one magical property of the item. If there are more magical properties, the caster is told only that more properties remain, but not how many.

Casting this spell requires the caster to physically handle the item. This may expose them to any curses or other touch-activated enchantments possessed by the item.


#### Spells B


##### Bless


#### Spells C


##### Cause Fear
##### Charm Person
##### Continual Darkness
##### Continual Light
##### Curse


##### Cause Light Wounds

* **Components:**
* **Target:** One living creature
* **Range:** 5 ft'
* **Duration:** Permanent
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** When used on a target within melee range (no contact is necessary), the victim takes 5 + Caster Level in damage, doubled if the target is an enemy of the caster's faith.


##### Cause Serious Wounds

* **Level** Cleric 4
* **Components:**
* **Target:** One living creature
* **Range:** 5 ft'
* **Duration:** Permanent
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** When used on a target within melee range (no contact is necessary), the victim takes 12 + Caster Level in damage, doubled if the target is an enemy of the caster's faith.


##### Cure Light Wounds

* **Level** Cleric 1
* **Components:**
* **Target:** One living creature
* **Range:** Touch
* **Duration:** Permanent
* **Save:** Body (if unwilling)
* **Effect:** If used on a target with HP less than max, target is restored **2 + (Caster Level)** hit points. If the target is an avowed member of the Cleric's faithful congregation, the effect is doubled.


##### Cure Serious Wounds

* **Level** Cleric 4
* **Components:**
* **Target:** One living creature
* **Range:** Touch
* **Duration:** Permanent
* **Save:** Body (if unwilling)
* **Effect:** If used on a target with HP less than max but above zero, target is restored **2 + (Caster Level x 2)** hit points. If the target is an avowed member of the Cleric's faithful congregation, the effect is doubled.

If used on a target that is already below zero HP, instead restore 4 + Caster Level in lost CON stat points to the target (double if they are of the faith). If this restores their CON to original value, any remainder on the roll is applied to restore HP. The caster can target themselves with this spell.


#### Spells D


##### Darkness
##### Detect Evil
##### Detect Invisible
##### Detect Magic


#### Spells E


##### Entangle
##### ESP


#### Spells F


##### Find Traps

##### Finger Flame

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:** S
* **Target:** Self
* **Range:** Self
* **Duration:** Instant or Sustained
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** With a snap of the fingers, this spell ignites a tiny flame at the tip of any one of the caster's fingers. This light functions as a candle that can be sustained. It can light fires, provide basic illumination, ignite pipeweed, and so on. The fire does no damage (even to targets weak against fire) can not be used as a direct weapon, but otherwise can do most anything a normal candle light can do.


##### Floating Disc
##### Free Person


#### Spells G


#### Spells H


##### Hide Alignment
##### Hold Person
##### Hold Portal


#### Spells I


##### Invisibility


#### Spells J


#### Spells K


##### Knock
##### Know Alignment


#### Spells L


##### Levitate
##### Locate Object


##### Light

* **Level**
* **Components:** V, S
* **Target:** Self, 1 object, or 1 creature
* **Range:** 30 ft.
* **Duration:** 6 Beats (+1/caster level)
* **Save:** Body (see below)
* **Effect:** Light is a versatile spell, with effects depending on the target. If cast upon themself, a small fist-sized orb of light appears in the caster's hand. The orb provides a 15-foot radius of strong light. The caster cannot use their hand for other purposes, or the spell is canceled.

If cast on an object, the object glows with the same strength of light, which lasts until the spell is done. If cast on a creature, the creature must make a Body Save or be blinded for the duration of the spell. In each case, the duration of the spell is the same, and the caster can cancel it at any time.


#### Spells M


##### Magic Missile

* **Level** Magic-User 1
* **Components:** V, S
* **Target:** 1 or more creatures
* **Range:** 150 ft.
* **Duration:** Instant or up to 6 Beats (+1/caster level)
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** When cast, this spell creates one or more glowing (or shimmering, etc) missiles of pure force, appearing in a shape declared by the caster (if undeclared, arrows are a suitable default), perpetually hovering within a few feet of the caster for up to the spell's duration or until used. A _Dispel Magic_ effect can prematurely end the spell's duration.

At the time of casting, the magician can choose to immediately launch some or all of the missiles at one or more targets. If the caster chooses to keep any of them in reserve, any number of them can be launched later as a combat action. When launched, a missile flies unerringly to a target that the caster can see (the caster can choose multiple targets if launching multiple missiles). Active _Shield_ spells block all _Magic Missiles_ cast upon a target that round before dissipating. Upon connecting, each missile does exactly 5 points of damage.

At first level the caster can create a single missile. At every two levels above 1st (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) the caster learns to create an additional missile, to a total of 8 missiles at level 15.


##### Mindmask
##### Mirror Image


#### Spells N


#### Spells O


#### Spells P


##### Personal Massager

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:**
* **Target:** Single body part (Self or one willing target)
* **Range:** 5 ft.
* **Duration:** Sustained
* **Save:** None (target must be willing)
* **Effect:** This spell gives the target body part a pleasant relaxing massage. If used in place of a Camp Action choice, target receives a Boon on their next die roll.


##### Personal Sountrack

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:**
* **Target:**
* **Range:** 120 ft. radius
* **Duration:**
* **Save:**
* **Effect:**


##### Phantasmal Force


##### Poke

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:**
* **Target:** 1 noun
* **Range:** 60 ft.
* **Duration:** Instant
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** This spell lightly pokes the target with an invisible finger-like force. The force is not enough to move, dislodge, or otherwise physically "affect" the target. If the target is conscious, the target is aware that it has been poked, but not necessarily by whom or what.

Poke will not wake sleeping targets. See **Slap** instead.


##### Protection from Evil
##### Purify Food and Water


#### Spells Q


#### Spells R


##### Read Languages

##### Red Magic

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:** S
* **Target:** One thing.
* **Range:** Line of Sight.
* **Duration:** Whenever.
* **Save:** Maybe?
* **Effect:** This spell makes the target red.


##### Remove Fear
##### Resist Cold
##### Resist Fire

##### Roll For It

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:**
* **Target:** Self
* **Range:** 5 ft.
* **Duration:** Instant
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** Before casting this spell, the caster and a number of willing targets must have a decision that must me made, with a number of options greater than 1. When cast, this spell temporarily conjures a phantasmal polyhedral die with sides equal to the number of choices for the decision you are trying to resolve. The die then rolls itself and lands on a random number for all to see. With the decision made, the die vanishes. Once determined, the die will never roll a different number if cast again for the same decision. (*inspired by ThrowTheGnome*)


##### Rummage

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:**
* **Target:** 1 Bag
* **Range:** 30 ft.
* **Duration:** Instant
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** Upon casting this spell, the caster must target a bag and have a specific desired item in mind. The spell then looks through the contents of that bag and alerts the caster if said item is or is not within it. If the desired item *is* in the target bag *and* said bag is currently held or worn by the caster, *and* the caster is also currently holding a different item of similar size, they can summon the desired item to their hand instantly, swapping it with the item previously held, which is placed safely in the target bag.


#### Spells S


##### Shield
##### Silence 15' Radius


##### Slap

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:** S
* **Target:** 1 noun
* **Range:** 30 ft.
* **Duration:** Instant
* **Save:** Body (Special)
* **Effect:** This spell slaps a designated location of the target with an invisible phantasmal force the size of a human hand, glove size L (9in/22.9cm). The slap is instant, audible, and painful, but leaves no marks and deals no damage. If the target is conscious, the target is aware that it has been slapped, but not necessarily by whom or what. If Slap is cast upon a sleeping target, that target is awakened, unless its sleep is of a magical or such nature that can only be broken by specific circumstances (such as unwanted and possibly illegal sexual advances from entitled royalty).

The first time a target is affected by Slap, they are not allowed a save. Each subsequent Slap allows them a Body save. A target that saves against a Slap is unaffected, and cannot be targeted by your Slap for 24 hours.


##### Sleep


##### Slow Burn

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:**
* **Target:** 1 torch, candle, or lantern (w/ oil)
* **Range:** 10 ft.
* **Duration:** 1 beat
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** This spell adds a single beat of light to any one mundane light source. A light source affected by a Slow Burn can not be affected by another. (*inspired by ThrowTheGnome*)


##### Snake Charm
##### Speak with Animal


#### Spells T


##### Tastes Like Chicken

* **Level** Cantrip
* **Components:**
* **Target:** 1 meal
* **Range:** 20 ft.
* **Duration:** 1 hour (6 Beats)
* **Save:** None
* **Effect:** This spell makes the target meal taste like chicken if eaten within its duration.


#### Spells V


##### Ventriloquism


#### Spells W

##### Web
##### Wizard Lock


## Wait a Sec... What about Level 9 Spells?

Ah, you are an observant one, yes, you will do well in the adventures to come... So you've probably noticed that due to the 15-level limit on characters, and the progression rates for Elves and Magic-Users, there are no opportunities for them to "safely" memorize and cast 9th-Level spells.

Yes. This is intentional. In the world of HAMMERCRAWL! such spells are legendary creations of the greatest (and most insane) ancient wizards. The Elves refuse to touch them, for fear of the ways they warp the nature of the world and befoul the wellsprings of life. Only human Magic-Users can ever learn them, and even then they can never "safely" cast them due to the restrictions on leveling and the nature of their Highcasting ability.

As for how to find them? Well, dear adventurer, that's why you must always go as deep into the dungeon as possible, to find the ancient madness that lurks beneath...


## Magic Items

**Author's Note:** Magic Items are very much a work in progress. Most often I default to using the amazing *Encyclopedia Magica* books from The OG when I run HAMMERCRAWL! for my friends. However, over time certain items have become canon to the game and its world, and as this happens they will be added here.


### Magic Armours


#### Elven Armour

Elven Armour is specially made with the combat caster in mind. Authentic elven-crafted magic armour significantly reduces its wearer's spellcasting penalties. Elven heavy armour has only a 5% spell failure rate, while Elven plate armour has only a 15% spell failure rate.


### Magic Weapons

TBD


### Magic Miscellany


#### Amulet, Boob Plocket

The Boob Plocket is an amulet that is magically invisible when worn. It gives the wearer an extra worn Bag with three Small slots in an extradimensional space. When the wearer attempts to retrieve an item they have stored in the Boob Plocket, they must first succeed at a target 15 Mind Save. If failed, the wearer forgets that they have placed it there and must first look through every other Bag (and nook and cranny of their current location) before remembering it. (*Inspired by ThrowTheGnome*)
